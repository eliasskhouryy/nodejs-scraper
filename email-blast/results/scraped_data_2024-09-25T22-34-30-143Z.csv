We need new ways to detect and prevent supply chain attacks. Stacklok is developing new tools and approaches, in alignment with open source communities. New from Stacklok: Minder Cloud Sign up now Video Overview Learn more about our approach This video explains how Stacklok's products, Trusty and Minder , work together to help secure your software supply chain and proactively protect your software projects from malicious attacks. Minder Cloud Minder Cloud helps open source developers and communities use open source security tools and standards to continuously secure their software projects, and provide proof of that security to their downstream consumers. Learn More Consistently configure source code repos No more manual configuration and spreadsheets. Use Minder Cloud to apply and consistently enforce the same set of policies across a group of project repos. Find safer open source dependencies Minder flags dependencies in pull requests that have known CVEs or high supply chain risk, and provides a list of safer alternatives to help developers find a different package to use. Secure GitHub Actions and CI/CD pipelines Implement GitHub-recommended best practices like limiting workflow permissions and pinning actions to commit SHAs (Minder can even do this automatically for you!). Daniel Finneran Isovalent ""We had well over 100 repos at one point, and all needed some level of review. It would be ideal to be able to set a basic security standard for repos, automate as much as possible, and have remediation steps."" Blog Announcing Minder Cloud: A fully managed software security platform for open source communities Continue Reading Make safer dependency choices Trusty makes it easier for developers to understand whether an open source package is authentic, non-malicious, and actively maintained. It's free to use and accessible as a web app and as a Visual Studio Code extension. Learn More Activity scoring Get quick signal with our Trusty Score, which establishes a benchmark for average levels of activity based on statistical analysis of public GitHub package data. Package provenance When artifacts have been signed using Sigstore, Trusty displays a verifiable chain of trust back to the source code so that you know the package is what it says it is. Package recommendations Trusty uses generative AI to provide a list of related packages and their scores, so that you can find and evaluate other packages if you need a safer option. Matt Klein Founder, Envoy proxy “Package activity is a key predictor of its health and safety. That's why Envoy's policy on external dependencies includes evaluation factors like number of commits in the last 90 days, release notes, and whether other projects depend on it, so that we can make safe choices.""

We know you're busy and have made a sincere commitment to making sure your computer problems get fixed FAST.

And if we can't make it right, the service is free. 3 No Geek-Speak. You deserve to get answers to your questions in PLAIN ENGLISH, not in confusing technical terms. Our technicians will also not talk down to you or make you feel stupid because you don't understand how all this ""technology"" works. That's our job! 4 Peace Of Mind. Because we monitor all of our clients' networks 24/7/365, you never have to worry that a virus has spread, a hacker has broken in or a backup has failed to perform. We watch over your entire network, taking the management and hassle of maintaining it off your hands.

http://www.attestant.io,"Home Posts Press & Media AOR Team FAQ info@attestant.io Don't invest in cryptoassets unless you're prepared to lose all the money you invest. Cryptoassets are high-risk investments and you are unlikely to be protected if something goes wrong. Take 2 mins to learn more The Business of Staking Attestant® is a company dedicated to the business of staking. It provides a non-custodial Ethereum staking service, giving customers the ability to stake their ether using Attestant's infrastructure while always retaining full control of their assets. Stake Ether Without Requiring Infrastructure Attestant’s managed staking service gives customers the ability to stake their ether using Attestant’s infrastructure while always retaining full control of their assets. Combining Technical, Risk And Treasury Management Expertise Attestant® has been formed by a team with decades of experience in technology, risk, and treasury management at the highest levels. We believe Ethereum is the future of decentralized finance, and for it to succeed as a serious competitor to fiat-based economies it will need secure and reliable partners that provide a range of services to support the ecosystem. The Attestant Difference Attestant® provides an institutional-grade staking service for holders of ether, allowing you to participate in the staking economy of Ethereum, earning rewards while helping to secure the Ethereum network. Attestant® has designed and built server architecture, software systems and operational processes that manage staking at scale in Ethereum. Features Secure Reliable Visible Simple Safe Accountable Secure. Your ether is secure with Attestant®. Ethereum validators use two separate keys: one to attest and one to move funds. Attestant provides the former and you generate and retain the latter, ensuring that Attestant has no access to your ether. This non-custodial system gives you the highest level of security as, without the key that only you hold, no-one can move your ether.

We help form and maintain companies, focusing on exceptional customer experience, scalability, and compliance. Andrew Pierce, CEO and Founder Andrew's journey began with a mistake—applying for a Corporation instead of an LLC. He didn’t realize the difference between the entity types until tax time, when he had to spend countless hours undoing his mistake and working with a CPA to ensure he was paying his taxes properly. As a new business owner unaware of the legal complexities of U.S. business entities, Andrew chose to handle the formation himself to avoid the high cost of professional services. This decision cost him time and money in the long run. This experience inspired him to found Company Sage, providing accessible, expert legal guidance on business formations at a fraction of the cost. With experience in corporate structuring from his time in the Caribbean and a degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, Andrew leads with both passion and expertise. Jennifer W.

Discover How About Us Individual therapy and self-care tools aren't enough. Support the whole team by breaking well-being down into measurable quarterly goals and rituals to improve ways of working. Discover Now The Science Behind Quan How does it work? It’s as easy as…. 1 Personal Assessment Team members complete an evidence-based well-being assessment measuring five dimensions: Mind , Body , Meaning , Social-Connectedness and Self-Fulfilment - providing invaluable insight on the underlying reasons for their current state. Assessments are 100% guaranteed private - no one else can see your individual results. 2 Team Well-Being Retro The well-being data collected in the assessments are aggregated and anonymized, highlighting the team's top well-being strengths and risks and their underlying sources. Quan then guides managers and teams through quarterly conversations about team well-being, allowing them to effectively choose which areas to focus on first, and to build the psychological safety they need to openly discuss their ways of working. 3 Targeted Rituals & Next Steps Teams select recommended rituals to improve their way of working. These easy-to-implement actions are proven to be effective by scientific research in organizational and behavioural psychology. Additionally, HR and Senior Leadership can identify more effective company well-being offerings and steps to better support your people based on aggregate well-being data across teams.

Meet Mona The insights engine behind trustworthy AI MONA’S INSIGHTS ENGINE Ultimate granularity (without the noise) Anomaly Detection Unparalleled depth to pinpoint anomalous segments in high-dimension datasets Noise Reduction Common Thread Analysis TM reduces noise by correlating related anomalies and identifying the root cause of the issue. Mona customers experience as much as 80% reduction in monitoring alerts per month. Sample Scenario An AI model scores the fraud risk of every online bank transaction. This is mission critical for the bank and directly affects the end user’s experience. Model accuracy is dependent on access to input data stored on browsers (e.g., Cookies). Browsers constantly evolve and are controlled by third parties. When deployed in this model environment, Mona can ingest and track event logs from every transaction, including model inputs and outputs, and various metadata. Mona can then detect when the model shows abnormal output distribution for a small sliver of the transactions and pinpoint the root cause as a data access issue in a particular browser segment.

constant changes and updates It is becoming increasingly important to track the constant changes, updates, and improvements related to compliance programs. With the software tools from APSM as part of your compliance solution, this challenge actually becomes manageable. Learn More YOUR INFORMATION, EVERYWHERE YOU NEED IT Complete control of your compliance, anywhere, anytime Reports, updates, and open items can be viewed from anywhere, using your smartphone, tablet, or any other device. Operations, safety, management, and corporate all have access to the same information, keeping everything running smoothly. Learn More Capture. Track. Improve. Maintain. Report. With compliance software tools from APSM integrated into every element of your PSM program, you can improve efficiency, documentation, and overall compliance. Tasks and assignments are tracked automatically, and email reminders keep things running smoothly. Learn More Specialized OSHA and EPA Compliant Safety Management Software designed for your needs We specialize in PSM Other software products focus on a wide variety of features but end up becoming bloated and ignore the small details. At APSM we’ve refined our software to focus on exactly what our customers need from a PSM tool. 20 years of experience Our software was built to solve real world problems that we ourselves were facing. Born from the need to better communicate and manage compliance programs on an enterprise scale, APSM software has only gotten better as we continually strive to improve and update our product. Customer peace of mind We have rigorous backup protocols and database monitoring in place to ensure the security and safety of all your data. Our technical support team is also available to assist with any problems. Rest easy knowing your data is safe. TESTIMONIALS What our clients are saying about us ” After careful consideration of several programs I chose APSM to serve as the web based program to support PSM/RMP efforts. Between the functionality of the APSM program and the support of the APSM staff I have no doubt I made the right decision. The APSM team delivers on what they say the system is capable of doing, drives to ensure upgrades/updates based on customer suggestions/needs, and are always available to answer questions and offer support. Jill Tubbs Director of Environmental Compliance, US Foods ” APSM has provided fantastic support to our PSM efforts for 20+ years. Their software simplifies our coordination efforts for a fully functional, compliant PSM program. I have recently retired from my previous company, but continue to offer consultation services if and only if my customers choose to use APSM products. Bret Niedens PSM Professional Consultant, BLN PSM Consulting LLC. ” APSM has dramatically helped our family of companies overcome the challenges of managing and complying with the many required components of PSM regulations… I highly recommend the tools at APSM to manage this complex compliance program. Kim Lacey Corporate Risk Manager, OPC ” The process safety management aspect of our organization of multiple subscribing facilities, each with many full-time and seasonal/temporary employees, and more than 250 pieces of equipment has been managed with a small team. The tool is very powerful and well supported by APSM. Don Tragethon Regulatory Liason, WPS ” Pilgrim’s is extremely pleased with the overall ability and ease of the APSM web-based product. We have been using it since around 2013 and wouldn’t ever go back to the old method of managing PSM via folder/files on servers. The APSM platform is rather easy to use and robust – probably the best I have seen in my 35 years in the industry. Steven Samolyk PSM Manager, Pilgrim's Pride ” Dean Foods has partnered with APSM with great overall success… APSM is a very powerful but simple to use platform to help us manage our Process Safety Management program to perform audits, track recommendations, and other required PSM/ARM tasks.

Rising maintenance and labor costs Despite rising costs, property managers are forced to continuously add headcount to stay on top of turns and prevent units from becoming ticking time bombs. Property data is disconnected Not only is collecting property condition data time-consuming, disconnected, and labor-intensive, trying to recall that information later is close to impossible with paper systems. A never-ending to do list Proactive maintenance decreases costs and increase resident and owner satisfaction, but most days are spent in survival mode just trying to get the bare minimum accomplished. a better way Grow faster with less overhead RentCheck helps property managers save time and increase visibility on routine property inspections on a user-friendly, resident-led platform.

They take our feedback and keep improving the platform. We can't recommend them enough!"" Jess Giles - Whole Property Management ""RentCheck is an excellent way to set and forget your routine inspections or to begin an inspection process. If you are looking for a solution to improve or leverage your unit inspection process, RentCheck just makes perfect sense."" Aaron Houser - Rebate Rentals ""Now that we use RentCheck, residents can conduct the inspection themselves saving us time. Rentcheck has also proved invaluable upon move out. It’s very easy to compare the move in report with the move out report. Easy to show support charges against the resident deposits. It’s a much more comprehensive report than we previously utilized.

""We used this app in Jackson,WY and through Teton National Park. As we drove through Teton NP, we listened to the historical story of the area. It gave us so much more understanding of the area and added so much to our drive. It’s really easy to use and added so much to our trip. Would gladly use it again."" - LinnyOzz “Awesome app - This app is great when traveling around Wyoming. The stories told make you appreciate what you are driving or walking through! A must have whether you are a local interested in the history and wildlife or a tourist on the go!” - Travelstorysgps lover! “Excellent app! - I love this app! We used it on a recent trip through Grand Teton Park and it provided us with a depth and breadth of information (regarding the park) to which we would not otherwise have access! I look forward to seeing what other tours will be added. Great work!” - IloveWyomingandtheTetons “Fantastic road tripping tool! - My family used TravelStorys to plan our trip to Jackson Hole and this app was indispensable! We listened to several of their tours through the Tetons and absolutely loved it. The app spoke to us while driving, so we didn’t have to look at the phone once!” - JGJ5511 “Great app for traveling families - When you approach a destination, the app will automatically start, you don’t need to do anything but listen.

http://www.dorsata.com,"SOLUTIONS ABOUT SIGN IN We believed the electronic health record could be smarter. Now it is. At Dorsata, we’ve reimagined the electronic health record experience to provide women’s health care providers, life sciences, and health plans with better point-of-care technology and clinical data. Built in consultation with hundreds of Ob-Gyns, our EHR tool embeds natively in the obstetrics workflow to improve patient care and aggregate rich and structured clinical data—across a nationwide network of providers and patients. Quick Facts 300+ women’s health practice sites across 20 states 2,500+ Dorsata clinical users 1.5M patients cared for annually by clinicians using Dorsata 250,000+ pregnancies and related data documented using Dorsata Our Solutions DORSATA PRENATAL The EHR never lived up to its initial promise—especially for obstetrics workflows. That’s what inspired us to build a point-of-care platform just for Ob-Gyns. We took the simplicity of the ACOG prenatal flowsheet and made it smarter—with ACOG clinical guidelines and a powerful rules-based engine to improve diagnosis, treatment, and documentation right at the point of care. LEARN MORE DORSATA INSIGHTS The underrepresentation of women in clinical studies creates information deficits in women’s health—with real world impacts for providers, health plans, and other businesses that rely on clinical research. For example, pregnant patients are nearly universally excluded from formal clinical trials and thus this population lacks clarity on whether certain medications and vaccines are safe for them.

Learn how MCR, the third-largest hotel owner-operator in North America, generated $3.4m in gross sales by selling extra parking spaces with Ocra. “At MCR, we measure success by RevPAR, revenue per available hotel room, and RevCAR, revenue per car. Ocra has helped drive those numbers higher.” Tyler Morse CEO & Chairman, MCR download Centralized online revenue management. Before Ocra, adding a new consumer demand channel meant the making time to log into yet another seller console every day. With Ocra, it’s one and done. Set pricing, manage inventory, and view reporting across all channels within one control panel. LEARN MORE Let the channels compete. Instead of divvying inventory up by channel, operators using Ocra pool their spaces in one “bucket” for all channels to access. High-performing channels don’t hit a revenue ceiling, and lower-performing channels aren’t saddled with excess inventory. When a spot sells through one channel, Ocra automatically removes it from the others. LEARN MORE Standardize data & desilo systems. Surfaced without context, data is just a string of 1’s and 0’s. Ocra tackles the fragmentation problem by building sophisticated integrations with demand channels. By standardizing how the channels name and refer to their data points, we make all technologies speak the same language. LEARN MORE Set access by user and location. Leverage the most granular permissioning in the industry today to give everyone in your organization the right level of access. Customize access on the location level or user level, and set read and write permissions for all features. LEARN MORE Consolidate & automate reporting.

The Crux team has been a vital partner, a significant contributor to our successful product development, and supported our transformation to a world-class software team through continuous best practice sharing.” Brian Case, CDO @ GE Renewable Energy “Working with Crux Digital on our internal design system has been a fantastic experience.

With Crux involved, we’ve been able to introduce additional tooling and libraries that have provided a more mature and systematic way to iterate, build, distribute, learn and repeat. With this increase in tool chain maturity comes increased trust from our consumers, as well as leadership recognition of our team’s value.” Sam Ashley, Sr Manager Design Systems @ Charter / Spectrum “My experience with Crux Digital was top notch. I outsourced the design and development of our next generation platform to Crux. Having worked with Crux in the past, I knew I could trust them as a thought partner, to consider our needs as if it was their own technical organization and follow through on design and development in a timely and thorough manner.

Waitlist and Reservations Management for Restaurants It does exactly what it says it will, and does it simply and intuitively. There aren't a ton of bells and whistles, which actually contributes to the ease of training, roll-out, and daily use. Additionally, I've found the development team to be truly interested in feedback and accessible for questions. · Training was -dead- simple on the software, extremely easy to roll out to team, and use is intuitive. Not a ton of frills or feature creep, but accomplished exactly what it said it would, which is exactly what we needed it to do, and it has done it flawlessly · There isn't the availability yet for multiple users or permission sets, which isn't the end of the world, but it means we don't have the ability to track who made which changes, as our whole team shares one username/password. That said, the lack of this feature hasn't impacted our ability to use it, and it has still worked beautifully for what we needed it to do Read more <img class=""lazyload"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://cdn.trustindex.io/assets/default-avatar/noprofile-02.svg"" alt=""Ade W."" /> Ade W. 2022-02-03 Great App, thank you So happy to find this app, help a lot in managing reservations. · Real time, texting and easy to use, mobile use · The app is not collecting customer's email, which could be useful.

http://www.cubist.dev,"Key Manager Company Blog Careers ‍ Talk to us Hot wallet speed + cold wallet security = Meet CubeSigner , a low-latency API for generating keys and signing transactions inside secure hardware. Stay safe from insider threats, app compromise, and costly mistakes without sacrificing performance. Talk to us Built by world-renowned professors and practitioners of applied cryptography, systems security, and formal verification. Web3’s most security-conscious teams use CubeSigner The key management status quo is downright crazy Nearly $700 M has been lost in 2023 to private key compromise and access control exploits. Are you surprised that keys get stolen? We're not. Introducing CubeSigner, a refreshingly secure key manager Secure Hardware Protect keys in secure hardware from generation to signing Your keys are exposed to attackers whenever software pulls them into memory. Why is any software still doing this?! We designed CubeSigner to handle keys in secure hardware 24/7 , from keygen to signing. As a result, no one–not even Cubist–can see, copy, or steal your keys. Policy Engine Give every key a custom security policy You know the sorts of messages each key is supposed to sign. Your key manager should, too: products that don't support policies—or that force you to use one policy for many keys—allow you (or attackers!) to sign clearly disastrous messages. CubeSigner helps you prevent disaster by, for example, requiring multiple approvers, insisting on 2FA for large transfers, or forcing transactions signed by a specific key to have specific data fields. Encrypted Export Recover keys directly to cold storage There are a lot of wrong ways to do key recovery: we’ve seen products send keys in zip files, copy keys in cloud accounts, display keys in the browser, and more. All these approaches expose your keys to attackers. Only you (or your users) can decrypt the encrypted backups produced by CubeSigner’s key recovery protocol. First, you designate a threshold of hardware tokens required to decrypt the backup. Then, whenever you create a key, you receive a backup ciphertext that’s cryptographically linked to your hardware tokens. Cubist consistently provides high-quality, well-documented code built with a security-first design. Their developers actively collaborated with our auditors and promptly provided fixes. It's a pleasure to review code for Cubist projects. Kostas Ferles Chief Research Officer of Veridise Security — not security theater Past Work Our work secures systems you use every day CubeSigner is the culmination of decades of our academic work securing production systems. We’ve designed and specified the cryptography underlying Ethereum, deployed fine-grained isolation in Firefox, discovered exploitable bugs in Chrome and Linux, and built automated reasoning tools used by Amazon, Certora, and others. WebAssembly and Back Again: Fine-Grained Sandboxing in Firefox 95 CT-Wasm: Type-Driven Secure Cryptography for the Web Ecosystem CVE-2019-11745: Out of bounds write in NSS when encrypting with a block cipher RFC 9380: Hashing to Elliptic Curves Issue 679643: Security: Use after free in PDFium's Annot::name Alloy*: A General-Purpose Higher-Order Relational Constraint Solver cvc5: A Versatile and Industrial-Strength SMT Solver Problem Space Building a secure key manager is harder than it looks You’ve got to design the system with security in mind from day one, so that your key manager: Ensures keys are not exposed during signing, import, or export. Protects users’ keys even in the presence of attackers or insider threats. Prevents attackers from exfiltrating keys via side-channels. Depends on trustworthy libraries and is safe against supply chain attacks. Provides low latency, high throughput, and high reliability without sacrificing security. ... and more. Ignore the slick marketing. Key management is hard—it takes more than a sprinkling of shiny cryptography or vague references to secure hardware. System Design We build on gold standards , not magic dust Secure hardware is the gold standard for key protection in high-security applications because it can create keys that are only accessible to a specific piece of code . Wielding this guarantee to reduce the attack surface in a real system takes skill, though: You must choose secure hardware wisely. As the ongoing saga of attacks on Intel SGX shows, not all “secure” hardware is actually secure. CubeSigner uses AWS Nitro Enclaves sealed to standards-certified HSMs—nothing more than minimalist, well-studied functionality. All software that touches keys must be correct . More complex tech stacks make correctness harder, and naively jamming code into an enclave doesn’t fix bugs. CubeSigner’s enclave code is small, simple, written in safe Rust, built on battle-tested dependencies, and designed to enforce security properties using techniques pioneered in our academic work. But wait... what about MPC? We have deep academic experience with MPC, which is why we don’t recommend it for production. First, MPC protocols and the software that implements them are extremely complex, leading to splashy, security-breaking bugs that suggest worse lurking beneath the surface. Second, MPC’s slow signing speed encourages people to cut (security) corners in the name of performance. Finally, most protocols’ security assumptions don’t align with reality. MPC protocols, for example, assume that parties are independent, while many real-world systems deploy multiple copies of the same software on the same cloud infrastructure from the same account. Put simply, MPC has practical limitations. Read more ↗ What’s the matter with doing crypto in the browser? Some key managers endanger users while claiming to empower them with in-browser crypto. This crypto is dangerous because it's usually written in JavaScript, a language that takes fine-grained control over code execution out of applied cryptographers' hands. The JavaScript runtime may indiscriminately replicate your keys, leave your secrets strewn about long after they're useful, or optimize in ways that reveal secrets through subtle differences in the timing of operations. Use JavaScript for beautiful wallet UXs, not for handling keys! Read more ↗ The security/convenience tradeoff is over Instantly support many blockchains Sign transactions for Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, EVM chains, and Ethereum’s Beacon chain, or sign raw hashes with Secp256k1, Ed25519, and Stark. To add a new chain, all you do is hit a new endpoint. Sign in milliseconds CubeSigner signs messages in tiny fractions of a second at over 99.999% reliability. It can support performance-critical use cases like high-frequency trading, which is impossible if you’re managing keys with MPC. Vary custody setups Use CubeSigner to manage your own keys or to manage end-user keys; choose between an end-user model where only your users can initiate transactions, or where your application can initiate transactions on their behalf. Lock down signing in an emergency Instead of giving developers, users, or organization members access to raw keys, CubeSigner grants fine-grained, instantly revocable signing sessions. You control who can sign which messages when, and can instantly revoke signing sessions in an emergency. Monitor and audit your system Set up alerts for signing requests that violate policies, for suspected signing token compromise, and for on-chain activity that’s inconsistent with CubeSigner logs. Eliminate complex attack vectors We use constant-time crypto and physical isolation to protect against side-channel attacks. The policy engine makes it easy for users to wield the least privilege possible, and our scoped sessions make least privilege mandatory. CubeSigner powers awesome applications Staking Protect your validators from insider threats, slashing, front-running, and catastrophic mistakes, with endpoints for Etheruem staking, unstaking, and validator signing via a Web3Signer-compatible interface. Read more ↗ Consumer Wallets Create safe, frictionless wallet experiences without seed phrases or other web3-native complexity. Use primitives for social login, two-factor authentication, multi-factor approval, key recovery, and transaction monitoring to customize each user’s wallet security as their risk profile changes.

Read more ↗ Trading Automate low-latency trading with the CubeSigner API, and define custom, per-key safety policies to protect assets in different accounts. Specify, for example, that a key can transact with a DEX only for a restricted set of tokens, or with a specified set of wallet addresses up to a certain transaction value.

http://www.primordial-labs.com,"Skip to Content Home Team Product News Contact Anura translates operator intent into autonomous action Primordial Labs is developing the next-generation human-machine interface, Anura, to empower warfighters to be active collaborators, not passive observers, when teaming with uncrewed systems (UxS). With Anura, operators can task robots like they would a human teammate by using natural language. Meet Anura 00:00 00:00 Unmute Settings Enter fullscreen % buffered Play Video is not available or format is not supported. Try a different browser. Our Approach Our mission is to build human-centric autonomy that puts collaboration between the human and robot as priority number one. We believe the path to mass adoption of autonomous systems is to make the communication mechanism, not the robot itself, more human. Anura: Natural Language Understanding + Platform-Agnostic Autonomy Anura blends natural language understanding with an embodied autonomous agent to enable speech-to-action capabilities for uncrewed systems, battlefield management systems, and more. Anura leverages a conversational human-machine interface (C-HMI) that translates verbal, mission-type orders from natural language to complex autonomous platform and sensor behaviors. It does this by extracting and distilling the operator’s intent with respect to the current mission context. Natural Language Understanding Platform-Agnostic Autonomy Anura’s platform-agnostic autonomous agent controls platforms, payloads, and sensors based on the operator’s intent extracted by the C-HMI. This allows Anura to take action in the real world, whether it’s manipulating software or a physical platform. Why Anura? Maximize your autonomy stack Integrate with existing equipment Up-skill existing on-board automation Avoid vendor-lock Empower the warfighter Reduce cognitive burden Democratize access to UxS Provide heads-up control in the field Anura makes communicating with robots more human by leveraging natural language Use Case 1: Uncrewed System Command & Control (C2) Anura enables warfighters to employ uncrewed systems (UxS) with minimal distractions. Users can task drones using natural language, verbally expressing their intent. Anura does not listen for key words or require memorizing a script. Instead, Anura extracts and distills the operator’s intent and translates that into autonomous actions for the platform to execute. Use Case 2: Multi-Domain, Multi-Agent C2 As the size and complexity of human-machine integrated formations grows, single operators will be responsible for commanding multiple robots on the battlefield simultaneously. Using Anura, operators can task platforms individually via call-sign (e.g., “Falcon”), or as a team (e.g., “Team Alpha”), using natural language. Teams can be formations of heterogeneous platforms in the same or different domains. Battlefield Management Systems Use Case 3: Anura is not limited to the command and control of uncrewed systems. Operators and analysts can use Anura to interact with complex software systems such as common operating pictures. Anura’s conversational interface makes complex scene management and large-scale operations faster, more intuitive, and more natural.

I hear pathologists say “we know we have to go digital but we just have no idea where to even start”. Lumea bridges that gap. By providing a scaleable solution for individual pathologists and/or practices.” Adam Cole, MD TruCore Pathology Founder & CSO Frequently Asked Questions I want to use digital pathology but I have no idea where to start! Where do I begin? Get our free Digital Pathologists’ Playbook, your step-by-step guide to going digital. The booklet includes step-by-step instructions, vendor lists, specs to keep in mind, how to get a return on investment, and must-attend annual events that will keep you up-to-date on the latest news and tech. Download it for free here: https://lumeadigital.com/digital-pathologists-playbook/ Is there ROI in digital pathology? Yes, there is a return on investment and it can be seen in multiple facets. If you utilize certain histology and tissue technology, that investment return is typically seen within 3 months of the initial investment. If not, cost savings will be seen in the following: storage, shipping, consultations, AI analysis and efficiencies, scalability both in the lab and with pathologists, advanced analysis, physical transportation of both personnel and slides, turnaround times, streamlined and centralized and most important, improved diagnostic accuracy. Read more about ROI in digital pathology . Is digital pathology as accurate as traditional pathology? Yes! There have been many research studies on the accuracy of digital pathology compared to traditional with the result of diagnosis being consistent independent of the method. It’s important to note that the accuracy of both digital and traditional pathology largely depends on the skill, experience, and training of the pathologist. Additionally, the quality and calibration of digital equipment and the digitization process can influence the accuracy of digital pathology. Read more about digital pathology accuracy What exactly does Lumea do? Lumea’s products can be summed up in four basic categories: tissue-handling and histology tech that improves specimen quality and workflow efficiency, an IMS/Viewer, an all-in-one digital pathology-enabled LIS, and consulting services to help you move digital pathology from idea to successful implementation. Is Lumea limited to the urology/prostate market No! Lumea’s IMS handles all small surgical biopsies. The IMS also integrates with our tissue technology to create never-before-scene pathology efficiencies, which we pioneered with prostate tissue but are continually expanding into other specialties. Learn more Will digital pathology slow me down? Like anything, change comes with a learning curve. Typical digital pathology has seen some minimal improvements, such as faster access to slides, easier consults, and additional digital tools. Lumea is invested in unleashing the full potential of digital pathology via integrated tissue technology and software to optimize pathology in ways never seen before. Read more about digital pathology speed Read more about digital pathology efficiency What measures are in place to ensure the security and privacy of patient data, especially in compliance with US regulations? Digital pathology can be designed with robust security measures to protect patient privacy and prevent unauthorized access in accordance with HIPAA, HITECH, and other relevant requirements. Modern encryption and authentication methods allow for secure connections, even over the internet, between web browsers and applications. Vendors should have the documentation they can provide upfront to prove compliance, but if that documentation does not satisfy your questions you should discuss it with their Information Security Officer. An important note: Your practice will be responsible for the compliance and security of the devices you use for pathology, such as securing work computers and keeping passwords safe. Is digital pathology too expensive? The cost of implementing digital pathology can vary widely depending on several factors, including the scale of the operation, the specific technology chosen, and the location and resources of the healthcare institution. While there are material upfront costs associated with digital pathology, consider the potential long-term benefits , such as increased efficiency, improved accuracy, eliminated transport costs, and the ability to offer and receive rapid remote consultations. A well-implemented digital pathology system may lead to cost savings and better patient care. Here are some cost-related considerations you will want to keep in mind while contemplating digital pathology and comparing different vendors.

alt=""Customers love us on G2"" /> Associations Love Using Our Centralized Platform. “The ability to have a user-friendly, easy-to-access online platform for board members, no matter how tech-savvy they are! The ability to schedule meetings, hold conversations, store documents, take minutes, and more has eliminated multiple, confusing emails from occurring. The time I have saved using Boardable for three boards that I manage has allowed me to focus on furthering our mission and vision.” Catherine J. Princeton Community Housing, Inc. I love Boardable! “I love Boardable! Over the years, we’ve tried many tools for various processes, only to be disappointed. It often feels like software companies just want to secure the sale, knowing it’s hard to walk away after the financial commitment. But Boardable has genuinely transformed our meeting preparation and management. It’s made everything easier and more professional, actually delivering on its promises.” Steve Shunsberger Bethlehem Township Municipal Authority Essential for Boards & Committees of Every Size. “Boardable makes it easy to collaborate with the various group administrators in putting together the agenda and collecting materials for the meeting…. My absolute favorite thing is the automatic meeting reminders Boardable sends out the day before a meeting.” A.N. Nonprofit Organization Management Supporting Boards & User Adoption is Now Possible. “It is great to have one place for board members to go for polls, documents and meetings. I use documents so board members can access orientation and other resources. I build agendas in Boardable and related meeting documents are just a click away for board members. I like conducting polls about whether to meet in person or online.” Sharon S. Strathcona County Library Preparing & Facilitating Meetings is Now Made Simple. “Boardable was the tool Futuro Health needed to effectively equip our Board of Directors with the information they needed for seamless board meetings. From an administrative perspective, Boardable is easy to use and templates for agendas and minutes make facilitating meetings a breeze. From a user perspective, members are able to easily access materials and participate in a paperless environment. I conducted a lot of research prior to adopting a board management tool, and Boardable has not disappointed.” Tessa Miley Futuro Health A Great Resource for Large Nonprofit Boards “I really enjoy the easy user interface and the ease of scheduling meetings and creating board books. I also appreciate the polling capabilities for voting. It seems easier to use than others we’ve tried for our board.” Jennifer S.

Case Study Vulkan Validation Layers By design, Vulkan device drivers provide no error checking. However Vulkan application developers will need a way to validate that they are using the Vulkan API correctly while developing their applications. The solution described in the Vulkan Specification was to define validation layers as a critical, if not mandatory, part of the development process. LunarG worked closely with The Khronos Group and the Vulkan Working Group member companies to develop a solution.

http://www.dorsata.com,"SOLUTIONS ABOUT SIGN IN We believed the electronic health record could be smarter. Now it is. At Dorsata, we’ve reimagined the electronic health record experience to provide women’s health care providers, life sciences, and health plans with better point-of-care technology and clinical data. Built in consultation with hundreds of Ob-Gyns, our EHR tool embeds natively in the obstetrics workflow to improve patient care and aggregate rich and structured clinical data—across a nationwide network of providers and patients. Quick Facts 300+ women’s health practice sites across 20 states 2,500+ Dorsata clinical users 1.5M patients cared for annually by clinicians using Dorsata 250,000+ pregnancies and related data documented using Dorsata Our Solutions DORSATA PRENATAL The EHR never lived up to its initial promise—especially for obstetrics workflows. That’s what inspired us to build a point-of-care platform just for Ob-Gyns. We took the simplicity of the ACOG prenatal flowsheet and made it smarter—with ACOG clinical guidelines and a powerful rules-based engine to improve diagnosis, treatment, and documentation right at the point of care. LEARN MORE DORSATA INSIGHTS The underrepresentation of women in clinical studies creates information deficits in women’s health—with real world impacts for providers, health plans, and other businesses that rely on clinical research. For example, pregnant patients are nearly universally excluded from formal clinical trials and thus this population lacks clarity on whether certain medications and vaccines are safe for them. Dorsata Insights provides you with technology to collect real world clinical data in a meaningful, standardized ways from our network of women’s health providers and their millions of patients.

The browser is a general-purpose tool. If you need to do serious work, here is your edge. What Kiwi Offers Kiwi offers a range of features designed to make your Gmail and Google Workspace experience seamless and productive. All of Your Gmail Accounts Distinct from what Gmail uses in the browser, we designed a powerful engine that allows multiple accounts to be used together with 100% fidelity and no conflicts. It works with Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides as well. With our Elite plan, manage up to 9 of your own Gmail or Workspace accounts in one application. No more switching between browser tabs, accounts and windows. Just pure productivity. The Focus Filtered Inbox Redefine your inbox on the fly to see what's come in today, or the past 2 days, or past week. Further whittle those down to only emails marked Important with Google AI, Unread, Attachments and Starred. Combine them to keep your inbox limited to a short list of your most relevant emails. Need to see your other emails? All it takes is a click to mix it up or turn it off. Never Lose a Document in Tabs Again You close a document, then struggle to find it. Not anymore. Kiwi tracks them as you use them. Open your recent documents, across all your accounts. Google Docs, Sheets and Slides - Transformed Making Google Apps work like a Full Desktop Suite, Kiwi is the go-to solution for office productivity that competes with Microsoft Office 365.

Until now, there has been no effective way to identify, track, secure, or measure the efficiency of AI generated code. Costs and code vulnerabilities are skyrocketing in both human-written and AI-generated software development. Many companies rely on point tools that fail to provide comprehensive visibility to identify, track, and remediate issues. These tools focus solely on what is developed, neglecting critical factors like who developed the code, leaving access and productivity risks unchecked. Software leaders struggle to effectively manage engineering budgets and measure performance while simultaneously balancing development investments with critical security measures to prevent cyberattacks and data breaches.

http://www.infrashield.com,"wowslider.com PROTECTING THE WORLD™ ONE PLANT AT A TIME Become Secure Home Become Secure What We Do How We Do It Who We Do It For Contact Us BECOME SECURE WITH YOUR DECISIONS Having the right knowledge, and high confidence in that knowledge, is critical to making well educated decisions. Failure to do so can have drastic ramifications on your organization's reputation, finances, or in some cases even peoples' lives. InfraShield can provide you the confidence you need by implementing a security framework catered to your organization's particular needs. We don't stop there, however. We independently test your organization's implementation in order to provide management with concrete evidence that a good security posture is in place. BECOME SECURE WITH YOUR INFORMATION Information is the backbone for your organization. It affects the decisions that your organization makes. Disclosure of your organization's information can cause the loss of a competitive advantage, or have others lose faith in your organization. If the integrity of your information is in question, how can you have confidence in the decision made using it? InfraShield can help you organize your information so you know where it resides, who has access to it, and when and how it is modified. BECOME SECURE WITH YOUR TECHNOLOGY Technology is everywhere. It's easy to see the convenience and benefits, but is it so easy to see the risks? Consider that every piece of technology around you is a potential threat to your organization. When viewed in such a way, the challenge is not only daunting, but seemingly impossible. InfraShield can break this herculean task into a few simple processes. We can prevent the introduction of technology that can be harmful to your organization. We can allow you to detect and prevent the addition or removal of rogue devices. We can also make sure that new technology you purchase will not introduce new vulnerabilities to your security posture. BECOME SECURE WITH YOUR STAFF Don't hide from it. Insiders are one of your organization's greatest threats. Don't believe us? Whether it is simply someone making a mistake that allows adversaries or malware onto your systems, or a disgruntled employee hell-bent on the total destruction of your organization, InfraShield has tools and procedures to detect, defend, and recover from insider threats. Know thy enemy and Know thyself Fear Not A Hundred Battles. -- Sun Tzu WE ALIGN SECURITY WITH YOUR GOALS A security strategy that fails to properly align with your organization's goals will certainly not be effective and most likely will not even be implemented. By understanding your organization's mission and goals, we provide a security framework customized to your organization that explains to management, employees, and even vendors why security is important and what their responsibilities are. WE DETERMINE YOUR THREATS The largest threat to your organization is underestimating the adversary. Making assumptions that no one is interested in exploiting weaknesses in your organization, or that generic solutions are sufficient. We understand the adversaries. We know how they think, the tools and methods they use, and how capable they are. We know what attracts them, and what dissuades them. The threats are increasing . The adversaries are becoming more sophisticated. You must be prepared. WE DESIGN A SPECIFIC DEFENSE STRATEGY We aren't going to sugar coat it, there is a lot of bad security out there. Your organization isn't the same as every other organization. The threats against your organization are not the same as every other organization. So why should your defensive strategy match every other organization? Generic solutions will only defend against generic threats. We determine which threats affect your organization's goals. We then create a specific defense strategy catered to meet and defend against those threats. We use defense-in-depth to ensure that failures in particular technologies or procedures do not cause a failure in your overall defensive posture. WE TEST THE STRATEGY Can you imagine if doctors, police officers, or firemen didn't test their skills and procedures? That would surely be crazy. Too often, organizations spend valuable resources creating a strategy but fail to adequately test it. It is imperative that this testing occur not just once, but on a periodic basis to ensure that the strategy is still effective. We can play the part of the adversary. Testing your strategy in a controlled and methodical way, ensuring that you discover any weaknesses prior to your adversary. WE TRAIN PERSONNEL Lack of knowledge and experience can add exceptional risk to your organization. Having state of the art technologies and plans in place are often defeated simply by human error. Training reduces this risk and minimizes attack vectors, such as social engineering , where humans are involved. Our training is unique . We train specifically to your industry and even your organization . Many individuals leave the average security training confused as to how it pertains to their daily duties, responsibilities, or even their industry. Management of many is the same as management of few. It is a matter of organization -- Sun Tzu How We Do It InfraShield uses a unique process that ensures complete protection from supply chain to retirement. The unseen enemy is always the most fearsome. -- George R.R.

http://www.innovahealth.com,"Why Innova Our Way The team FAQs Contact Join The Team Watch Our Video A Faster, Easier MORE POWERFUL EHR Solution for Senior Care Therapy Innova’s “Intelligent Clinical Ops™” is a faster, easier and more powerful EHR solution for senior care therapy. This comprehensive, user-focused system enables therapy providers to optimize business and patient outcomes in an increasingly complex rehab environment. With an initial launch in skilled nursing, Innova's ""cloud-based"" platform will soon operate seamlessly in multiple therapy settings including Home Health, Assisted Living, and Independent Living, as well as Virtual Therapy. Imagine ONE EMR software system... with seemless operation in MULTIPLE therapy settings. powerfully simple. Does Your EMR System Remind You of the 90's For All the Wrong Reasons? EHR software was designed way back in the 90’s… and not much has changed since. That was a fun era. But today, most people could do without all the boy bands, rollerblades and dial up internet. Likewise, most therapists would gladly do without the slow, clunky and cumbersome nature of the 90’s EMR technology that remains with us today. Haven’t we all waited long enough for the future to arrive? To Build a Better EMR system, We Let a Bunch of Therapists Get Bossy With Our Engineers Most EHR systems are designed by software engineers. And while ours are among the best, we thought therapists should have a hand in the process too. We started by asking them what they liked… and what they didn’t like about their current EHR software. Without being caddy, let’s just say one list was a lot longer than the other. In the end, our therapists got what they wanted… and our engineers did too… a faster, easier, more powerful approach to Electronic Health Records. We Talked to Operators Too, and They Got Pretty Darn Excited Ok, maybe not this excited, but they were definitely enthusiastic. A lot of them wanted to help us with the project. Some even invested. Why?... because we understand that post-acute rehabilitation is changing fast, but EHR systems haven’t. Therapists don’t just treat in one location anymore, and sometimes they don’t even deliver care in the same therapy setting. Outcomes management tracking is more critical than ever, and value-based payments are quickly becoming a reality. We’re addressing the challenges of a more demanding post-acute rehabilitation environment… and more. We Want Your Thoughts Too We want to make sure that we’ve eliminated all the things people hate about their current EHR system, so we can make one they’ll love. If you’re a Therapist, Director of Rehab or in a Leadership position, we’d love to get your perspective too. Drop us a line at info@innovahealthtech.com if you’d like to share you thoughts... At Innova, “user-centric” isn’t just a catch phrase… it’s a company core value. Contact Us The Solution is “Simple.” Current EHR solutions are a complex web of add-ons, workarounds and bandaids introduced to keep up with an increasingly complex healthcare world. “Why not start with a clean slate,” you might ask?... because EHR providers simply don’t want to incur the time and expense. But we did. By starting at the beginning, we were able to create a cloud-based system with a more streamlined workflow, less clicking and scrolling, fewer fillable fields, and none of the manual workarounds required with today’s systems. The end result, is a simpler approach to EHR... and in simplicity lies POWER. Power to the People While simplicity and ease-of-use have been key areas of focus in the development of Innova’s new Intelligent Clinical Op’s platform™, we also made it smarter and infinitely more powerful through innovation… and a lot of late nights. Take a look at the things we’ve been working on to make life easier... for therapists and operators: More Intuitive Workflow and Navigation Advanced process automation technology to simplify and streamline workflow Intuitive layout & clean design for easier navigation Less clicking & toggling, fewer fillable fields to reduce online fatigue Superior Scheduling Capabilities Automated scheduling technology reduces scheduling time from hours to minutes Easily schedule therapists in different facilities and settings Automated scheduling alerts for improved compliance Leading-Edge Clinical Outcomes Advanced outcomes tracking tools target value-based payments and refferals Functional deficit outcomes tracking for MDS, including GG and built-in standardized tests Monitor daily ""progress to goals"" info with ""at-a-glance"" patient outcomes dashboard More Efficient Patient Management Onboard new patients in seconds Utilizes a single medical record to follow the patient through the care continuum Digital patient board monitors new referrals, notes due and upcoming discharges At-a-glance access to all critical patient info... on one screen Enhanced Documentation & Compliance Tools Fastest & most intuitive clinical documentation system in the industry Patient notes in just minutes... at the point-of-care Defensible documentation: efficiency and compliance with best-in-class clinical libraries and compliance alerts Greater Flexibility – Online and Off Fully web and cloud enabled system for cost reduction and ease of operation Works on any mobile device for remote applications Integrated “off-line” mode for improved flexibility and effciency Superior Customer Support And Responsiveness Unmatched training and onboarding experience Continual product improvement - we’re listening Enhanced responsiveness and faster ticket turnaround Every customer matters – regardless of size Could This Be Love at First Sight? Have a look at our layout and design... and you just might fall in love. You’ll discover a modern, clean look with inutitive controls, more white space, larger font and softer colors that are easy on the eye… and the brain. The result?… a faster workflow experience, more intuitive navigation, and best of all… a little fresher perspective at the end of the workday. Patient control center allows clinicians to have all patient information at their fingertips to make sound clinical decisions Lower Your Pain Scale Being a therapist has never been so demanding. So we're bringing a little more joy back to the job by reducing the time they need to spend on their EHR system, so they can spend more time with patients. To make it faster, we had to make it easier too. By creating a more intuitive workflow, with more flexibility, we were able to eliminate a lot of the pain points that frustrate clinicians and and ultimately slow things down. Because its so simple, Innova's Intelligent Clinical Ops™ is also very easy to learn. In fact, most therapists are up to speed with the system in just a couple days... often without any formal training! Ultimately, our goal was to create more time for therapists to do what they love most… treat patients ! Sounds Great. How Can My Company Get Involved? Thanks for the interest! Currently Innova's Intelligent Clinical Ops™ is being piloted in several skilled nursing facilities in the U.S. to make sure the experience is nothing less than great. Our initial launch is slated for mid 2024 with our Advisory Board facilities who have graciously dedicated their time and knowledge to the project.

Their team has been able to support developing full test cases and protocols linked to each of our requirement specifications in the rigorous attention to detail necessitated when developing regulated medical devices.

Layer supercharged Tripledot's art creation, tripling our production speed and elevating quality. “By reducing our reliance on outsourcing studios, we've not only saved significant costs but also brought the magic of art production in-house. We're incredibly excited about this technology and eagerly await further updates.” Andriy Matviychuk VP of Creative, Tripledot Studios We were looking for a user-friendly solution that could easily onboard the team for generative AI pipeline integration. Layer was our choice due to the best user experience. It allowed us to speed up production of our merge games and save a lot of resource. Tatjana Kondratyeva CEO & Co-Founder, PlayPack With Layer AI, we’ve been able to closely simulate signature aesthetics of our in-house Proxi Art Style to explore a wide variety of concept art. This empowers our artists to exhaust possibilities in a lot less time than a ‘conventional’ workflow, which frees them up to prioritize key assets. In addition, the Layer AI team has been extremely supportive with addressing our feedback and making the tools better! Lauren Elliot CEO, Gallium Studios In the Wild West that is GenAI land, be more like our partners at Layer. Luke Dicken Head of AI, Zynga If we had to spend the full time for these characters traditionally, it would take us about 360 hours. With Layer it was around 40 hours for all of them, so a huge increase in productivity. Michael Cheal Art Lead, LBC Studios It's the only AI tool which I get to convince our Artists to use as a programmer. SD or Automatic1111 is impossible to use by artists in the pipeline. Adam Proctor Director of Game Dev., Uken Games At a high level, our creative process starts with sketching, continues with draft coloring, and lasts with final coloring. Normally, we are producing one level for our game in 15 days. With the help of Layer, we decreased this time to 5 days. Bulut Korzay Production Lead, Fortune Mine Games We're only allowed to work with Layer thanks to its attention to enterprise-readiness, thanks for unblocking gen-ai for our team! Alex Present Art Manager, IGT Layer changed our team's opinons on AI and motivated them integrate AI in our production pipelines. Solon Bucholtz CEO, LBC Studios Layer has been an incredible creativity booster, allowing us to explore multiple concepts at volume and in our own art style. It offers tons of control yet it remains super user friendly. Pablo Spreafico Head of AI Guild, Space Ape Games Layer impacted my personal philosophy about AI, I have absolutely zero fear about it. Sean Miller Ex-artist, Zynga We use Layer in backgrounds and slot machine designs, it cuts the time in half and sometimes not at all - but it almost always increases the number of creative ideas. Being able to create multiple variations is a huge time saver. Correcting the image by hand would take me all day, and correcting it in a layer - about an hour. Zofia Borowska Sr. 2D Artist, Huuuge Games We use Layer for creating item sets in our merge game as well as for our live events where we need a lot of backgrounds and offer assets. We recently expanded our usage to market assets. The results are great. The ability to give our sketch references and let Layer render in seconds his a huge time saver, I’d say we’re at least 3x more productive with Layer. Nihan Dal Artist, Wixot Games Layer's contribution to our art pipeline has been tremendous. We're able to produce assets in half the time. Before Layer, we used to create 3D models, pose the model then get a render. If we wanted to edit an asset we needed to go back to the model and take another render to edit the asset. This process is replaced by Layer. Additionally Layer multiply our abilities to think creativity by providing a few variations to choose from achieve outputs we couldn't think about before. Samet Soylemez Game Artist, Apps Teknoloji For a company like us who is focused on Merge-3 games like Merge Park, Layer has helped multiply our art libraries and production powers, we're 240% more productive thanks to Layer. Yagiz Gur Production Lead, Games United Creators first. Enterprise ready. Layer exists to scale creativity in teams of all sizes. It is easy to use, but with the depth to power enterprise-level.

The feature simplifies the complexities of both HCC models, presenting blended RAF scores in both 1/3 and 2/3 ratios. Each code is tagged to its corresponding V24 and V28 HCC model. This enables dual recapture utilizing both models ensuring users are not only ready for the transition but positioned to thrive within it. more about V28 For patients with a disease that maps to a v24 and v28 HCC, choose the most relevant ICD. When V24 and V28 RAF scores for a set of ICD codes for the same disease are equivalent – select a code that maps to both models, this will facilitate recapture. “Finally, our claims reflect the accurate disease burden of our value-based care population.” Dr. Wade Brosius Group Medical Director, PMSI Royersford, PA More Testimonials SAVE TIME AND MONEY Get it right the first time Prospective decision support and retrospective review options ensure your Medicare risk adjustment coding is evidence-based and accurate.

In our last venture, we listened carefully to the needs of healthcare professionals, and invented the first cloud-based EHR with touch technology on the iPad. It simplified the way providers interact with their patient’s health record and was top-rated by Medical Economics Magazine. This time around, you get the benefits of valuable lessons we’ve learned, our team knows how to transform complex workflows into a simple interface. about us Get the answers you need Questions about our web-based software, features, pricing, or anything else? Request a demo PROVIDERS Get the data you need We’ve reached the age of information overload. For many physicians it’s impossible to wade through months or years of medical records to determine the current disease burden / risk score of a patient. With ForeSee ESP, we do the reading for you, extracting clinical events and linking them to the original documentation, a real time saver. Clinical decision support is updated real-time so it’s available and accurate when you need it most - at the point of care. Your choice of the best ICD10 code is easy because the “likely used” codes are linked to the diseases you diagnose. CODERS Capture complete diagnoses If you’re a coding expert, then you’ve probably observed many different workflows related to supporting the HCC coding effort. The good news is, we support both prospective and retrospective workflows. If you plan on adopting a prospective model, we make it easy for coders to help the physician plan for the upcoming encounter. Communication tools make the transmission of coding advice simple. Work lists and reports augment a retrospective review of HCC opportunities that may have been missed at the point of care. ADMINISTRATORS Allocate proper resources Think of all the extra time and money spent on HCC tasks if accurate risk adjustment isn’t done right the first time, at the point of care. When ambiguity related to the disease burden of your patient population is reduced, the result is less inquires and faxes from coders and health plans. Use the ForeSee ESP Risk Adjustment Analyzer to track the medical group’s average patient risk score and compare to the projected score. Compare the risk score of segments of your medical group to be sure you allocate resources to those care teams that take care of the sickest patients. QUALITY TEAMS Improve health accuracy Patients are watching, now many carry an abbreviated version of their medical record on their mobile device. Let’s make sure that the list of diseases they see on their device really matches their clinical state. Our clinical decision support facilitates up to date and accurate disease coding. Accuracy is what we all aim for, we understand that HCC auditors are not just examining the new codes that were found, they also want to know your process for finding inappropriate or old codes. Your group's Delete Suspects report displays already used codes for which there is no clinical evidence.

Transparency in Coverage Requiring health plans (insurance carriers and self-funded employers) to publicly publish a machine-readable file of all negotiated rates, and give members internet-based tools to search for care and understand their out-of-pocket costs. Hospital Price Transparency Requiring hospitals to publish machine-readable files that include the gross charges, discounted cash prices, payer-specific negotiated rates and minimum and maximum negotiated charges for all services and procedures, as well as provide a consumer-friendly internet-based tool to allow patients to search for care and understand costs. 28% is the average variation in healthcare costs across and within networks. FAQs Have questions? What are the sources of Handl's data? Thanks to legislation like Hospital Price Transparency and Transparency in Coverage, all negotiated rates between carriers and providers, as well as gross charges and cash prices from hospitals, are publicly available. We gather this data and supplement it with other data sources like claims, Medicare rates and provider directories to create a holistic and accurate dataset. How does Handl gather the data? Just because it’s publicly available, doesn’t mean it’s easy to get. In fact, it can be quite the opposite! We’ve developed proprietary AI models that allow us to clean and organize publicly available healthcare price transparency data at scale. How does Handle ensure the data is reliable? Data reliability is our top priority. We transform publicly available pricing data to make it usable for benefits consultants with a 3-step validation process. This includes matching multiple datasets (from carriers and providers), comparing the rates against industry benchmarks and reconciling them with claims. Still have questions?

You need something that gives you real, usable insight into how your customers behave, giving you the data you need to make informed decisions. You need something that automates away the endless data entry and frees you up to finally be creative. You need something visual, intuitive, and fast, leaving you in a flow state for hours, instead of glancing at the clock while each page loads… slowly. The end result, of course, is that your customers can actually find what they’re looking for. The site performs better, and the company makes more money. You start using SEO insights to quadruple your organic traffic, and suddenly you’re riding the rocket ship.

YOUR ASSET. Lydions transform your data into assets for your company. Your data is valuable. Lydions let you extract, price, and monetize that value—without losing control of your data. Lydions are a new digital asset format that identify and extract the latent value and utility of enterprise data. Lydion ® applications use patented Transactional Proof-of-Work to turn your data into monetizable Lydion assets—utilized and transacted by you and your customers to solve critical business problems and generate new income streams. You retain complete control and ownership of the data used to create your Lydions, regardless of how they are used. Lydions are powered by your data and don’t require cryptocurrencies or other underlying economic tokens to have value. At the same time, Lydions interface seamlessly with all Web3 Layer 2 and traditional financial networks. Our partners have generated over $1B in value stored in Lydions while solving critical business problems for Fortune 500 companies. Most companies are generating valuable data but missing out on optimizing its returns. By transforming that enterprise data into Lydions, companies can increase their revenue by 37% and increase the asset value of the company by 19%. What can Lydions do for your enterprise? Let’s talk. The Opportunity for Data Economics and Lydions In these highlights from DECO’s 2022 Investor Presentation, founders Jennifer Hinkel and Arka Ray detail the current traction that Lydions are seeing in-market, the science and technology powering Lydions, and the Lydion-products that DECO will be revealing in 2022. Watch Now The unique features of Lydions let them solve problems that traditional, cloud-based client-server systems cannot. Lydion-based applications enable: Vaults: Lydions are managed in private, secure Vaults controlled by data generators/owners. Persistent Data Ownership: The data producer owns and controls the data in a Lydion, even after repeated uses. Transaction History: Lydions store and recall every transaction in which they have been utilized. Value Appreciation: The more a Lydion is used, the more (provably) valuable it becomes. Decentralization: Lydions are managed by fully decentralized apps, giving every user visibility and input on every transaction. Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Lydions can prove the value and utility of the data they contain without revealing the data itself. The word lydion refers to vessels from the Ancient Mediterranean that were used to store and ship rare and valuable goods. The presence of an ancient lydion vessel signified that the contents within were valuable. Similarly, when data is packaged into a Lydion ® , that means that the data is valuable. The Lydion container itself can provide proof of this value without revealing its contents. About The Lydion Magazine The Lydion Magazine is a quarterly journal dedicated to the exploration of how distributed computing and digital assets are being applied to solve the world’s “Big Problems”. Each Edition focuses on a single vertical, featuring stories by industry veterans at the front lines of the Data Economics revolution. Explore The Lydion Magazine About The Data Economics Company Lydions were invented by DECO (The Data Economics Company). DECO enables companies and people to convert their data into valuable digital assets that can be utilized, shared, and transacted using secure, private Lydion Data Vaults and Data Economics Networks (DENETs).

RocketKOR’s BaaS allows for the maintenance of the relationship between the bank, the client, and the customers.

Off-Chain Web2 AI-Agent Contract Ship AI agents in minutes Integrate with Popular LLMs and Web3 data layers The Graph Lens Protocol Airstack Get Early Access Build with familiar tools Learn More Backing 153 Contracts Explore Connect AI-Agent with 25+ Blockchains Instantly Join Agent Wars Learn More Phala Ecosystem Explore More Cutting Edge Web3 Usecases Learn More Trustless MEV Account Abstraction L2 Sequencer Decentralized API Web3 AI Distributed Computing Gateway & CDN Relayers & Validators Trustless MEV Trustless MEV refers to the concept of eliminating reliance on trusted service providers, such as Flashbot, in the Miner Extractable Value (MEV) ecosystem. Currently, 80% of Ethereum blocks are built by MEV, but the existing MEV stack depends on these trusted providers. The problem with this approach is that it creates a single point of trust in the MEV ecosystem. Researchers have suggested using Secure Enclaves, like Intel SGX, to minimize this trust dependency. Phala Network, an off-chain compute network powered by Secure Enclaves, can be utilized to build the MEV core stack with minimal trust assumptions. This enables a more secure and trustless MEV ecosystem for developers and users alike. Account Abstraction Account Abstraction is the idea of using smart contract wallets as first-class citizens instead of Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), alongside a reliable transaction relaying infrastructure. This allows third parties to execute transactions on behalf of users, enabling features such as wallet recovery and batched transactions. However, adoption of smart contract wallets has been limited due to the lack of a common standard for interaction between smart contracts and dApps. This results in users still relying on their EOAs for transactions. Phala Network’s Phat Contract allows developers to create seamless user experiences by enabling registration via social accounts or gasless dApp usage. It also allows developers to sponsor transactions on behalf of users, eliminating the need for users to worry about gas fees. L2 Sequencer Layer 2 solutions aim to scale applications by handling transactions off the Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 1) while maintaining the decentralized security of the Mainnet. However, rollups, a popular Layer 2 solution, introduce issues like monopoly pricing, censorship, and fragmented liquidity between rollups. Phala Network can provide a scalable and secure solution by leveraging its high-performance and confidentiality features. This enables developers to create application-tailored rollups that are fast, reliable, and maintain the composability of the Ethereum ecosystem. Decentralized API Decentralized APIs can enhance the trustworthiness of various services, such as Infura, Graph, Alchemy, and RPC APIs. Phala Network enables the aggregation of API services or RPC services with trustless algorithms, providing use cases like verifiable RPC aggregator switchers and trustless CDN management programs. This allows developers to secure their websites, APIs, and Internet applications while maintaining a decentralized and trustless environment. Web3 AI Web3 AI refers to the integration of decentralized AI systems with blockchain technology. This enables distributed model training, ensuring data privacy while benefiting from diverse data sources. It also allows for collaborative model development, where multiple parties can work on AI models without sharing sensitive data. Phala Network can facilitate the development of Web3 AI systems by providing a secure and transparent platform for AI model training, updates, and access. Smart contracts on Phala Network can ensure adherence to predefined rules and agreements, while the immutable nature of the blockchain provides an auditable record of these processes. Distributed Computing Distributed computing enables multiple computers to work together to solve complex problems, making a computer network appear as a powerful single computer. It can be used to encrypt large volumes of data, solve complex equations, and render high-quality animations. Phala Network offers fast, cost-efficient, and secure computation by running jobs where data is generated and stored. It can streamline existing workflows without extensive rewriting by running arbitrary Docker containers and WebAssembly (WASM) images as tasks. Gateway & CDN Centralized CDN services can lead to issues like single points of failure, data leaks, and centralized control. Phala Network provides a decentralized content and application delivery network that accelerates the delivery of Web3 content and apps. By connecting with decentralized storage services like IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave, Phala Network can create a transparent, content-addressable, and publicly available CDN. This ensures a trustless, censorship-resistant, and open-source environment for content delivery. Relayers & Validators The relay model for cross-chain transactions abstracts data verification into a consensus problem at the relay layer. A relay chain is developed for interoperability, with relay nodes deployed in each blockchain network to monitor and synchronize transaction data. Phala Network can help developers build inter-chain-native dApps with efficient liquidity utilization, coherent application logic, and shared states with cross-chain verifications. This eliminates the need for multiple isolated smart contract deployments on different blockchains, streamlining the development process. We help you build your future. Share your vision: Submit How Phala Network works Correctness Phat Contracts are deployed to the blockchain and assigned to the offchain workers, running inside Secure Enclaves. Anyone can check the signed transactions and Secure Enclave remote attestation to verify that the executed code is the one published on the blockchain. Replicated Phat Contracts are deployed to one or more workers, grouped as a Cluster. The contracts in the same cluster are replicated to further guarantee the availability. Thanks to the redundancy by the Cluster design, the developer can further validate the states across the workers to... Confidentiality Phala Network implemented end-to-end encryption during the full Phat Contract lifecycle. Secure Enclave acts as a two-way sandbox that encrypts input, output, and internet access, protecting the secrets in the enclave against software and hardware level attack.

We’ll do our best to answer a few of them here. How does accountability benefit me? Shame, embarrassment, or fear often hold us back from opening up conversations about unwanted porn use. Choosing to use our accountability app nudges open those doors. A better life - free from porn - comes with ""unexpected positive side effects"" says Cole (happy customer). Benefits of accountability include: Safeguard in weak moments, knowing a friend sees your online activity Improved mental health as you make healthier viewing choices Proof you're choosing to commit to your relationship instead of porn Rebuilding trust in relationships over time Regular ongoing conversations about meeting positive goals Increased motivation and time to pursue your dreams and goals Will this really work for me? 95% of people see an immediate and significant reduction in porn use. In fact, most stop viewing porn entirely, and for those who want protection from a potential problem in the future, being accountable gives great confidence. This not only works, it is life-changing! If Ever Accountable isn’t amazing for you, we will refund your payments for the last three months. That is how confident we are that it will work for you. Here’s what David, one of our many users has to say about us: “This software has definitely provided a sense of security and accountability right off the bat. I was surprised how it is helping to rebuild my confidence while keeping me honest with myself even when no one is looking.” Does your app report banking information? Ever Accountable does not share financial app information on mobile devices. But, if a banking website is visited, it is possible that some information may be recorded. We recommend using a banking app instead of a website. Are there loopholes? Ever Accountable is the most robust accountability app that we know of. It was built by geeks who know all the tricks and how to block them. Just don’t look for loopholes, because they probably won’t work. Even if they do work once, we’re constantly making updates (some of them silently in the background) to fix them! Does EA block all porn access? By default it does not. The magic of Ever Accountable, the reason it works so incredibly well, is that it is built on the timeless principle of being accountable to another person. When we know that someone else can see what we're doing, the temptation to look at bad stuff melts away. That being said, filtering can be a great supplement. On Android and iOS you can turn filtering on at no extra charge. It activates safe search, so that garbage you don't want to see is far less likely to show up accidentally. It filters out known porn, malware, and spyware sites. It doesn't get everything – which is why accountability is so important. But it is nice to know that gigantic cesspool of porn is just not something you will have to deal with. How does one choose an accountability partner? This is an extremely important question. Choosing a great accountability partner will help eliminate the urge to view porn. Consider these things when choosing the right person, they need to be: Supportive Non-judgemental Trustworthy Reliable A supportive accountability partner cares deeply and know that it is a process. This person should be non-judgemental, honest and understands that no one is perfect. It’s helpful if they have similar values or have been through a similar experience. Accountability partners need to be trustworthy so that honesty can flourish. Reliability is important! Accountability partners need to view reports in a timely manner and not be afraid to call someone out when needed, and have those tough conversations. When we find someone with these qualities, even when you stumble, we “fail forward” and grow. We will have the support you need to succeed. How many devices does this cover? Your subscription covers ALL of your devices. There is no limit! We do this so that you and your loved ones will have no reason to not be protected on all your devices. We support all major platforms including: Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, Chromebook, and Kindle. Work and browse online with confidence, knowing that we've got you covered. Everybody has moments when we're not at our best. What about privacy? We don't just pay lip service, but take your privacy very seriously. To our knowledge Ever Accountable is the only accountability app to be ISO certified in either information security or in privacy. We have both. That means we put a ton of time and effort into keeping your data safe. This includes things like top notch encryption, a dedicated data safety officer who reports directly to the CEO, and a thousand other details. Our systems are regularly audited to prove it. We did this voluntarily. You are accountable, so we want to be accountable too! View more FAQ’s We need each other. Sign up today and experience the peace of mind you deserve.

I rebooted my thinking and created Membrain to help my company turn how we sell into a competitive advantage.

Across millions of sales engagements, our unique approach— using proprietary data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to identify a single recommended offer for individual customers —has increased providers’ ARPU from 5 to 20+% since the day we launched. the right offer , for the right customer , at the right time With bundles, speed tiers, channel packages, OTT video additions, mobile plans, home security services, WiFi extenders, and more, the number and complexity of options make it difficult for a customer to make the buying decision that’s right for them. This “paradox of choice” frequently results in an outcome that suppresses ARPU while leaving a customer unsatisfied with their services, or confused and unwilling to make a purchase decision at all. To solve this problem, agents and digital sales channels need to understand who a customer is and what they want. Our platform begins by uncovering and interpreting previously inaccessible customer information — then, using prescriptive artificial intelligence, we recommend the offer that best meets the customer’s needs and buying preferences.

Patient Age 70 The explanations in this report help me feel empowered to discuss my medical care with my doctor. Kudos to whoever came up with this new option! Super super helpful.

This does make it much easier to have a discussion with the doctor and also saves me time looking up information on the internet where the information might be misinformation. Patient Age 78 Love it. Easy to understand, every Doc should use this Patient Age 71 Excellent presentation; helped me have layperson-level insight into the results. Patient Age 69 This form of feedback can reduce or eliminate anxiety/fear with a simple, clear explanation of findings and this promotes the best possible outlook and outcome for the patient. 😊 Patient Age 29 I love this!

So much valuable information presented in clear, concise terminology. Patient Age 58 This makes understanding my test results a very easy task.

Patient Age 57 Very illuminating and gave me peace of mind. Patient Age 73 I have never received this level of detail in a diagnosis. It is great. Thank you.

The wall of love ilya @compumit_group Loving it guys. Ultra-fast and robust software! Jesús Vivas @jesus_vivas Nice product, looks like my productivity will improve using this browser. Po-Hsuan Wei @pohsuanwei Sidekick has made my work more efficient for months. The tabs are quick to load as compared to Firefox or Chrome (for Google Drive, Outlook, and Overleaf), and Chrome extensions are compatible with Sidekick (e.g., leanlibrary). Psychological work-leisure separation is also achieved by separating the work browser from my regular browser. Kelly Sparrow @bestdealsext I absolutely love this. Thank you!!! Ishwar Jha @ishwarjha Sounds like a browser for modern time. Clean, fast, organized. Kudos to the team. Chris Davis @cgdorio1 I’ve been using it in Beta for the past couple months and loving it! It does a fabulous job of maintaining a full browser experience while also integrating many of the key features of products like Shift, Rambox, etc. without the caveats of a whole separate application. Zach Weisman @zach_weisman1 I’ve been using this for a couple months and love it! Saves so much time logging in/out of a zillion SaaS products. I like that I can have 2 gmail sessions open in 1 browser at all times. I can remain logged into tall of my work related apps such as Figma, Asana, Jira, Confluence, Airtable, Google, etc… Maxim Rudenko @maxim_rudenko Nice work! Absolutely perfect browser for everyday working routine. Srujana Bobba @srujanabobba It’s cool. Thanks for building such beautiful product. I am sure I will be using this product, especially the sessions feature. Steven Tey @steventey Congrats on shipping, Sidekick team! I’ve been a beta user for a while now and the product has been really effective in saving processing memory, which is amazing! There have been some hiccups here and there but the team is very responsive and fixes the bugs pretty quickly. Good luck! Rus Sellers @joshturveymusic I love Sidekick. I am constantly hunting out tools that help simplify and streamline my workflow and I have been dreaming of this day where i can have one place for pretty much everything in my world. I always have groups of tabs on multiple browser windows that used to grind my processors to a pulp – that is no more, Sidekick has changed it for ever – its like I have a new faster machine now!

It is commonplace to encrypt passwords and care for online banking safety, but many people still use the online browsers as if they are safe by default. With Internet stakeholders, hunting for the user’s attention and engagement, taking modern browsers as neutral instruments is not realistic. This is partially why private browsers win increasingly get more attention. We are here to tell you more about Sidekick, the safest online workspace, a new browser for PC, designed to focus your attention. Is the Sidekick browser safe?

With the software tools from APSM as part of your compliance solution, this challenge actually becomes manageable. Learn More YOUR INFORMATION, EVERYWHERE YOU NEED IT Complete control of your compliance, anywhere, anytime Reports, updates, and open items can be viewed from anywhere, using your smartphone, tablet, or any other device. Operations, safety, management, and corporate all have access to the same information, keeping everything running smoothly. Learn More Capture. Track. Improve. Maintain. Report. With compliance software tools from APSM integrated into every element of your PSM program, you can improve efficiency, documentation, and overall compliance. Tasks and assignments are tracked automatically, and email reminders keep things running smoothly. Learn More Specialized OSHA and EPA Compliant Safety Management Software designed for your needs We specialize in PSM Other software products focus on a wide variety of features but end up becoming bloated and ignore the small details. At APSM we’ve refined our software to focus on exactly what our customers need from a PSM tool. 20 years of experience Our software was built to solve real world problems that we ourselves were facing. Born from the need to better communicate and manage compliance programs on an enterprise scale, APSM software has only gotten better as we continually strive to improve and update our product. Customer peace of mind We have rigorous backup protocols and database monitoring in place to ensure the security and safety of all your data. Our technical support team is also available to assist with any problems. Rest easy knowing your data is safe. TESTIMONIALS What our clients are saying about us ” After careful consideration of several programs I chose APSM to serve as the web based program to support PSM/RMP efforts. Between the functionality of the APSM program and the support of the APSM staff I have no doubt I made the right decision. The APSM team delivers on what they say the system is capable of doing, drives to ensure upgrades/updates based on customer suggestions/needs, and are always available to answer questions and offer support. Jill Tubbs Director of Environmental Compliance, US Foods ” APSM has provided fantastic support to our PSM efforts for 20+ years. Their software simplifies our coordination efforts for a fully functional, compliant PSM program. I have recently retired from my previous company, but continue to offer consultation services if and only if my customers choose to use APSM products. Bret Niedens PSM Professional Consultant, BLN PSM Consulting LLC. ” APSM has dramatically helped our family of companies overcome the challenges of managing and complying with the many required components of PSM regulations… I highly recommend the tools at APSM to manage this complex compliance program. Kim Lacey Corporate Risk Manager, OPC ” The process safety management aspect of our organization of multiple subscribing facilities, each with many full-time and seasonal/temporary employees, and more than 250 pieces of equipment has been managed with a small team. The tool is very powerful and well supported by APSM. Don Tragethon Regulatory Liason, WPS ” Pilgrim’s is extremely pleased with the overall ability and ease of the APSM web-based product. We have been using it since around 2013 and wouldn’t ever go back to the old method of managing PSM via folder/files on servers. The APSM platform is rather easy to use and robust – probably the best I have seen in my 35 years in the industry. Steven Samolyk PSM Manager, Pilgrim's Pride ” Dean Foods has partnered with APSM with great overall success… APSM is a very powerful but simple to use platform to help us manage our Process Safety Management program to perform audits, track recommendations, and other required PSM/ARM tasks.

http://www.tagone.com,"Establishing trust, one link at a time For nearly two decades, we've been helping companies identify and overcome supply chain traceability compliance challenges across industries. Let us help you navigate your FSMA 204 compliance journey and lay the foundation for a better tomorrow. SaaS Offerings Winner of FDA's Food Traceability Challenge Read More > Simplify supplier integration #comp-lyagh8qk svg [data-color=""1""] {fill: #FFFFFF;} #comp-ly60fens1 svg [data-color=""1""] {fill: #FFFFFF;} Avoid complex & costly system upgrades Advanced compliance reporting #comp-ly61ffzs7 svg [data-color=""1""] {fill: #FFFFFF;} Some people are calling the FDA's upcoming FSMA 204 rule the largest single imposed change on the global food supply chain in history. This compliance requirement is estimated to impact nearly half a million global food establishments. At the rule's core are additional traceability record-keeping requirements for persons who manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods that the FDA has designated for inclusion on the Food Traceability List (FTL) . For FTL foods they handle, these persons must establish and maintain records containing Key Data Elements (KDEs) associated with different Critical Tracking Events (CTEs) and provide the requested information to the FDA within 24 hours or within some reasonable time to which the FDA has agreed. TagOne Compliance Link for FSMA 204 Companies impacted by this ruling may be feeling overwhelmed and considering this work as an additional burden and a complex undertaking. But the reality is that complying with these requirements will become a breeze with a little bit of planning, a little discipline, and some help from TagOne. With our TagOne Compliance Link solution we promise to take the complexity out of your FSMA 204 compliance journey. By leveraging our decades of traceability compliance experience, we have custom-built the solution from scratch, addressing the diverse needs of each partner type, across the supply chain. In our view, in an industry as big and diverse as food, a one-size-fits-all all kind of solution just cannot work. We believe a comprehensive FSMA 204 compliance solution needs to address 5 key things which we define as part of our compliance wheel. A complete understanding and coverage of: All roles across the supply chain Identification of the appropriate data types Flexible data capture options catering to different business user types Seamless data share capabilities Secure data repository for one-click reporting TagOne Compliance Link for FSMA 204 checks all the boxes. In fact, we can confidently say that in addition to helping you address the immediate FSMA 204 requirement, it will also help you use this investment as building blocks for the future, to drive competitive advantage. 1. SUPPLY CHAIN ROLES Helping companies across the supply chain address FSMA 204 Supply chain partners dealing in FTL foods be it Harvesters, Coolers, Packers, Wholesalers, Processors, Distributors, Retailers, Restaurants or others, will now need to capture, store and share additional information about these food items. What this means is that for specific pre-defined events performed across different roles in the supply chain (called CTEs), companies now need to capture and share specific pre-defined data elements (KDEs) defining that event. These CTEs include events like Harvesting, Cooling (if applicable), Packing, Shipping, Receiving and Transformation and supporting KDEs include data elements like Commodity (Food Item) name, Lot Number, transaction location, transaction dates, quantity, unit of measure, etc. Although this might sound like a lot of different KDEs defining multiple CTEs, the FSMA 204 data can be broken down into three main data types: Product Data Location Data Transaction Data 2. DATA IDENTIFICATION FSMA 204 CTEs & KDEs organized in one place These three data types fully describe a food item's movement as it progresses through the supply chain via tracking events and ensure the comprehensive traceability the FDA seeks to drive. Product Data In its simplest form, product data is information that helps identify the food item in more detail to avoid confusion about the commodity being tracked. This includes the product's name, brand, variety, packaging size, style, etc. This information is part of what the industry calls a Master Data element (Product/Item Master). I.e., the information has to be captured once and can be referenced repeatedly regarding the food product in question. Location Data Location data is meant to identify all the locations the food item has traveled over its life cycle, from the time of harvest (as in the case of a Raw Ag. Commodity) all the way to where the Retail Food Establishment (RFE) makes it available to consumers for final consumption. Typical location data includes physical location address or coordinates and key contact information like business name and phone number for all locations where the food product was handled. Like product data, location data is also part of a company's Master Data (Location Master). Transaction Data The transaction data is what ties the food item’s (product data) journey across the supply chain locations(location data), together. Each critical event (Harvesting, Cooling, Packing, Receiving, Transformation, Shipping) is uniquely defined by a set of KDEs assigned to them, as the food item moves through the supply chain. Examples of typical transaction data include KDEs like event date, event location, quantity & unit of measure (for the food Product) and Lot Number. 3. DATA CAPTURE Capture traceability data your own way The TagOne solution is set up to make data capture a breeze for our customers. Our solution provides 7 easy ways to help them easily capture Key Data Elements to support relevant Critical Tracking Events, as a food item moves between different supply chain partners across the supply chain. This is a vital first step to ensure a company’s compliance with FSMA 204, and an area TagOne has greatly focused on over the past few years. WEB UI EXCEL/CSV UPLOADS TABLET/MOBILE UI APIs MOBILE SCANNING OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION (OCR) REMOTE DATA ENTRY SERVICE WEB UI Simple to use UI that can be accessed and viewed via a web browser and used across different mediums like a desktop, laptop, or tablet. 4. DATA SHARE Ensure seamless data exchange with your business partners Once the relevant KDEs have been captured and stored for the different CTEs specific to a company's supply chain role, the next vital step is to share shipping KDEs with customers as efficiently as possible. This is a core requirement of the FSMA 204 ruling, and this is where TagOne's Integration Engine and Supplier Link solutions come in to make life super easy for our customers. The TagOne Integration Engine has been built to help customers address direct system-to-system data exchange requirements with TagOne. This could be linking their internal systems to TagOne or integrating with their business partners (external systems) to ensure the easy capture, storing, validation, and sharing of KDEs covered under the FDA’s Food Traceability Final Rule. TagOne’s Integration Engine supports leading data exchange protocols like SOAP, SFTP and AS2, data exchange formats like XML, JSON and is fully compliant with GS1 standards. EDI transactions between partners are fully supported. The TagOne Supplier Link has been custom-built to address the FSMA 204 compliance requirements of smaller and medium-sized companies that do not have IT systems to enable automated system-to-system data exchanges. For these scenarios, the TagOne Supplier Link provides companies with an easy-to-use web-based application that gives them multiple options to collect, store, and share FSMA 204 relevant KDEs applicable to CTEs their company is responsible for. For example, for distributors, this could be capturing KDEs for Receiving and Shipping, while for food processors, it would be Receiving, Transformation, and Shipping. 5. DATA REPOSITORY Advanced FSMA 204 reporting The success of regulatory compliance programs often boils down to the quick and easy availability of compliance data. This can be a significant challenge, particularly when meeting the requirements of a complex regulation like FSMA-204 which demands detailed traceability data for a food item, identified at the lot level, within 24 hours. With our extensive experience in the traceability compliance space spanning nearly two decades, we have not only been there and done that, but we have also gained a deep understanding of what it takes to simplify compliance reporting. This knowledge has led us to develop our Compliance Cockpit, a solution that not only facilitates 1-click FDA reporting but also equips our clients with multiple exception management and error handling reports, ensuring they are always in control of their compliance requirements. Check out our FSMA 204 compliance packages Our Solutions ""When we started our business, we knew we wanted to do it the right way, but didn't know where to begin.

Poor PQR, a product of aging and lossy electrical grids, encompasses both frequent and long power outages and poor voltage quality and are anecdotally known to disproportionately affect low-income households and marginalized communities in urban spaces. To address PQR inequities, researchers and policymakers often rely on normative theories of energy justice, capability approach and multidimensional poverty index to interrogate how poor PQR impact and exacerbates domestic electricity vulnerabilities in urban spaces. While useful, these theories remain limited due to the absence of granular and robust PQR data to quantify and address PQR disparities.

DANGEROUSLY ACCURATE. What’s the fastest way to drive revenue for your brand? Accelerate sales from your existing (and lapsed) customers. With Clario. “Clario is some of the best bang for the buck we get.” Jay Topper EVP & CDO > See Jay’s story Do you know how to get your online shoppers to visit a store? With Clario, you’ll know that, and so much more. Clario is the most powerful way to move the needle on sales. So plug in and buckle up. What is Clario? Clario is an end-to-end solution, built for consumer marketers, that outperforms any customer data technology of its kind. A customer insight engine: Clario tracks thousands of data points on every one of your customers—going back several years—and provides instant answers about your revenue potential, customer base, and high-level strategies. An audience builder: Clario combines a longitudinal view of your customers with ultra-accurate, hyper-fast machine learning to help you drive the right behaviors with the right customers at the right time. A customer data platform (CDP): Clario cleans, organizes, and leverages all of your customer data, no matter how messy or chaotic it may be—in less time and for a lower cost than any data tool you can find. A data science team: Clario’s team of coaches provide regular, ongoing guidance about how to drive revenue, build audience models, test campaigns, and create more high-value customers. Clario is every tool you need to create more of your best customers, all in one. Want to be a hero? Share Clario with your team. Download our executive brief and show leadership how Clario can drive revenue and transform results. Choose the version that’s right for you below, depending on whether you already have a customer data platform (CDP) or not. We already have a CDP We don’t have a CDP Leverage the power of your customer data — and uncover immediate revenue opportunities. Without Clario, sales are being missed. As retailers fight for every last dollar (and as the end of third-party data looms), the brands that stay out front will be the ones that mine their customer data for every last opportunity. This can’t be done with data in silos and it can’t be done with a bias toward certain marketing channels. Only Clario provides hyper-accurate, one-click predictive models with channel-agnostic insights. Only Clario can hyper-target your customers in minutes, not days. Get answers to your strategic questions, in 15 minutes or less: How do we acquire more customers who are more likely to make a second purchase? How are we doing with retaining our customers? How exactly should we be targeting customers to keep them coming back? How can we increase their lifetime value? How do we create more multi-channel customers? What’s the right frequency for targeting my customers so we can drive revenue without irritating them? How do I get my lapsed customers to buy again? Which customer attributes, and what kind of campaigns, should we be focused on to increase our customers’ lifetime value? Clario clearly — and quickly — shows who your best customers are and how to create more of them. see client success stories Hey, Clario. I need this by noon: Build me an audience of one-time buyers who are most likely to buy again. And refresh it in place every Monday. No problem. See More Clario Scenarios Warning: This audience builder will drive sales. Fast. Have you been sacrificing weeks of lead time or paying thousands in upcharges just to slice an ultra-specific segment of customers from your database? With Clario, it takes 45 minutes. Or less. Ready to Be Dangerous? Subscribe for Tips Schedule a Chat Hey, Clario. Did you update our audiences last night? And will you please remember to modify them in place every Sunday at 5 pm? Absolutely. See More Clario Scenarios Seriously. Get all this in an hour: Hey, Clario. Can you build me an audience that will drive sales with one-time customers? I want to get them to buy again—using the most cost-effective strategy possible. 45 minutes later Clario Here you go. I've created an audience of the 60% of your one-time buyers who are most likely to purchase again. This should generate results and also save on marketing costs. What? I usually wait three weeks for answers like that. What’s this based on? Clario I analyzed the buyers who made their second purchase from you last quarter—including what they looked like and how they differ from those who’ve never made a second purchase. I then applied machine learning to build an audience with similar characteristics. What are those characteristics? Clario There are hundreds, but these are the key findings about buyers who made a second purchase last quarter: They were primarily between the ages of 30 and 45. Most of them made their first purchase online, but 70% of them made their second purchase in store. Most of them bought sunglasses as their second purchase. For second purchases, direct mail and Facebook ads had a strong influence on these buyers. Those are valuable insights. I’ll make sure we include direct mail in our campaign and target the messaging to that demographic. Is this audience ready to go? Clario Yep. I've uploaded that audience to Facebook and Instagram, and I’ll update in place daily for the next three weeks while your campaign runs. And you can download this audience for your direct mail campaign. Let’s go sell some sunglasses. See More Clario Scenarios Careful. You might cause a scene. If you want to blend in with the crowd, Clario’s not for you. But if you’re done uploading data by hand—and ready for some truly smart marketing — so are we. “For me to get all the value that Clario provides, I’d have to add five people to my staff.” Jacquie Bailey Director of Customer Analytics & Marketing Operations Clario is for anyone who’s ever thought: “Isn’t all this data supposed to be driving sales?” Have you ever wondered why it’s taking weeks to dig insights out of your data? Wasn’t it supposed to be easier to leverage all this information? Shouldn’t we be moving beyond mass-targeted bulk messaging by now? The answer is yes. So what’s the holdup? The current systems weren’t built for the breakneck speeds and hairpin turns of today’s marketing demands. Clario was. When it comes to building audiences, there’s nothing faster, more flexible, or more accurate. Hey, Clario. Get this to me before lunch: Build me an audience of customers who’ve browsed our lawn mowers in the past six months without purchasing one — and tell me how much I should spend to market to them, based on predicted customer lifetime value. You’ve got it. See More Clario Scenarios It’s time to shake things up. With Clario, you’ll be launching whip-smart, laser-focused campaigns as fast as your team can create them. Your customers will see messaging that moves them. Your bottom line will see a boost. And your competitors will wonder what hit them. Ready to be dangerous?

We Make Your Great Idea a Successful App Get Started After spending months refining your app idea, you still have one question: who should you trust to build it? You're looking for app developers who understand why your idea is important. The ideal team builds your app because they believe in it. You want people who have done this before. They have answers to the questions that you don't yet know to ask. This isn't a search for the cheapest vendor. It's the beginning of a lasting partnership. Every decision at this stage matters. You need experts who know how to make your app a success without experimenting on your business. We've been there, and we've helped dozens of clients face the same challenges you are facing. In fact, we started Twin Sun to help good people build excellent software. Confidently Building Together Our first conversation will be about your business, your goals, and your vision for the future. Once we understand where your business is headed, we form a dedicated team to help you get there. You see a working app in your hands the very first week. You can review our progress as often as you like. We welcome your feedback at every step. You know the people building your app, and their good work shows you how much they care about your business. We work with you every day until your app is a success. Reaching Your Goals Within Your Budget Together, we plan a goal-based budget for creating a successful app. We discuss our progress every week to ensure we stay on target. We stand by the quality of our work. If we discover issues during internal testing or the first 30 days after your first App Store release, we fix them for free. Groundwork's CEO Jeff came to us with an idea that he had validated with potential customers. We worked together to define goals for his MVP that fit within his budget. With our help, he had paying customers using his new web app within four months. Launching When You Like We have launched apps with valuable user experiences in as little as one month. Your app will always be in a releasable state. We launch in the App Store when you decide it's ready. App Store updates occur as frequently as you wish. You are always in control of your product's release schedule. Technology Experts Twin Sun's team is led by technology industry veterans. We've been building mobile and web apps for 15 years, have worked for Inc 500 companies, served Fortune 100 clients, and (finally) started our own business. Today, our 100% U.S.-based team of developers and designers build products we're proud of for clients with great ideas.

Define Your Runtime Pick a deployment chipset from our curated optimizers or customize your own. Set up unit and regression tests, and define constraints like memory usage. Automate and Run Launch with our automated stack. Your code automatically adapts to the chosen runtime, enhancing efficiency with each iteration. < 1 > Input your code Load your high level prototype code written in Python, Matlab or Julia in your favorite IDE with the CodeMetal plugin installed. Our environment automatically tracks complex module and library dependencies, identifies low level language equivalents and provides a transpilation and deployment plan for your edge environment of choice. < 2 > Define your runtime Choose your edge environment configuration - pick a CPU (e.g. x86 or ARM/RISC), and a combination of accelerators including GPUs (e.g. NVidia, AMD or Qualcomm), FPGAs (e.g., Xilinx - Spartan, Virtex, Artix; Altera - Stratix, Cyclone; Actel or others). Specify available resources - RAM, VRAM, number of cores, number of LEs and others. Choose preferred toolchains (e.g., ROCm, ONNX, Vivado) you would like to integrate with your build. < 3 > Automate and Run Our agentic workflow will automatically generate a transpilation and deployment plan for your edge environment. You can interact with or simply execute the plan to produce generated code that will include embedded C/C++ or Rust for the CPU, synthesizable VHDL or Verilog for FPGAs, Cuda, HIP or ONNX code for GPUs. Then choose among variants automatically optimized for memory, runtime performance, code size or power consumption and build your binaries. < 4 > Track Changes Between Generated and Input Code Making changes to the generated code is easy. CodeMetal generates code that conforms to your coding standards and is easily readable by developers. Plus, we integrate into standard IDEs for team collaboration and code versioning tools. CodeMetal will detect optimizations you want to manually make to generated code and suggest matching changes and annotations to your input code. < Get started > Automate Your Edge Development with Code Metal Contact Us “Code Metal is accelerating development at the edge faster than any of its peers at a time where edge deployments are scaling rapidly,” Michael Brown Former CEO of Symantec & DIU Director Find Out More Benefits Maximize your development potential Discover the benefits of streamlined coding, high-quality standards, and robust security with CodeMetal.

""EdSights has perhaps the world’s most valuable data set on what college students need to navigate their academic lives."" Josh Tyrangiel, AI Columnist at The Washington Post testimonials What our customers are saying Dr. Paul Orscheln AVP of Enrollment Management Missouri Western State University Phenomenal. EdSights has produced some of the most profound retention outcomes I’ve seen in my 20+ years working in Higher Ed. While data around performance and attendance is readily available, EdSights has allowed our students to be purposefully engaged in their own journey to success. Elaine T. White AVP for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Vaughn College I've worked in higher ed for more than 30 years, and this was the smoothest software implementation we've ever had. It was so easy— EdSights did most of the heavy lifting and made it so pleasurable. Scott Barker VP of Student Advisement Southern New Hampshire Technology like a chatbot can reduce the time advisors spend on hands and head work and allows them to spend more time on the heart work. This ultimately is making their work more enjoyable and leads to better student outcomes. Dr. Cassy Bailey VP for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management Baker University EdSights has provided great insight and connection to our students with immeasurable results. Through the data, I became aware of those students who fell “between the cracks"". Students were connected immediately to resources, which positively impacted their experience and our retention number. Justin Schuch Executive Director of Retention Initiatives Western Illinois University We have really leveraged the interventions and risk levels (from EdSights) to be the driving force behind our entire retention strategy.

From the very beginning our program was built on our shared taste - we’ve always been drawn to the same aesthetics, and the art and design of the Nordic countries embodied the intangibles that most inspired us. First and foremost was our love for ceramics, and that shared passion has carried through our 25 year evolution. From dealing strictly in vintage works by masters of 20th Century Scandinavian design, to integrating a roster of contemporary artists (no longer exclusively Nordic), we have maintained a continuity in our program which honors what is closest to our hearts. Our galleries champion the unique qualities of the Nordic sensibility, promoting the work of virtuosic artists who have maintained deep investigative practices over many years. These artists are creating works by hand which exemplify the traits with which our gallery is aligned: a reverence for the natural world, integrity, intention, and above all - beauty! The power of beauty to transform our lives is undeniable, and the artists with whom we work compel us to continue to bring beauty to market as a force for life and love. — Kim Hostler and Juliet Burrows Hostler Burrows HB381 Back To Top","Since it looks like your team is focused on integrating a full roster of contemporary artists, both established and emerging, with historical works - ever thought about hiring for a ceramic artist or a sculpture artist in the Philippines?"

Every day. Data System Deephaven is an open-core * framework and query engine for working with streaming tables. Use dynamic data in tables with the same ease as static dataframes. Data Sources Access and ingest data directly from popular, standard formats. For example, use a Kafka event stream alongside historical Parquet data. Data Processing Stream updating and real-time derived data to consumers. Connect JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++ clients and receive live updates or snapshots. Write to persistent stores. Build and share real-time visualizations and monitors. Explore massive and ticking datasets with built-in tools. Connect enterprise apps. Data Consumers Exhaust new streams or write to persistent stores, build and share real-time visualizations and monitors. Explore massive and ticking datasets with built in tools. Build enterprise apps. Why Deephaven? Streaming data done right Serious performance Engineered to track table additions, removals, modifications, and shifts, users benefit from Deephaven’s highly-optimized, incremental-update model. A chunk-oriented architecture delivers best-of-class table methods and amortizes the cost of moving between languages. Client-server interfaces are designed with large-scale, dense data in mind -- moving compute to the server and providing lazy updates. Build, join, and publish streams with ease Build streams on streams to empower applications and do analysis. Use table operations or marry them to custom and third-party libraries. Query and combine batch and real-time data. Highly intuitive New data and events seamlessly arrive as simple table updates. Queries establish an acyclic graph, with data logically flowing to downstream nodes. Simply name a source or derived table to make it available to clients via multi-language APIs. Use easy methods to stripe and pipeline workloads. Familiar & powerful tools Leverage gRPC and Arrow. Use Jupyter, Visual Studio, JetBrains, or [soon] R Studio. Bring your custom or 3rd-party libraries and functions to the data for faster and well-integrated execution. Enjoy the data interrogation experiences of the Code Studio, with dynamic dashboards and an evolving suite of capabilities. Expressive Language Built for Developers, loved by Data Scientists Combine your static and real-time data sources Join and merge Kafka streams with Parquet files. Use identical operations on batch and stream. Join your time series and aggregate Streamline your data science Leverage gRPC and Arrow Flight Libraries from deephaven import ConsumeKafka , ParquetTools , TableTools from deephaven2 . parquet import read_table # data-ingestion integrations (Kafka, Parquet, and many more) table_today_live = ConsumeKafka . consume ( { ""bootstrap.servers"" : ""kafka:9092"" } , ""metrics"" ) table_yesterday = ParquetTools . readTable ( ""/data/metrics.parquet"" ) # merging dynamic with static is easy; the updating table will continue to update table_merged = TableTools . merge ( table_today_live , table_yesterday ) # operators can be used identically on dynamic and static tables (or merges of the two) table_joined = table_today_live . sumBy ( ""ProcessKey"" ) . naturalJoin ( table_yesterday . sumBy ( ""ProcessKey"" ) , ""ProcessKey"" , ""YestTotal = Metric"" ) UI Tools Open-source code studio for accelerated data exploration Browser based interactive REPL for immediate feedback.

Thanks to Wink Reports, I now have more access to more data, a lot faster."" Paul Steer Molokini Consulting Connect 25+ plug and play tools together See all data connectors Leap the barriers between data and business intelligence Your business software doesn’t deliver the report you really need Most business tools aren't very flexible. Some simply lack the reporting and analytics functionality that you need to solve specific business problems. Imagine a super flexible, spreadsheet-style reporting tool that you can fully customize... Your business tools each hold data, but they don’t talk to each other Even if your current software tools generate the individual reports you need, they don’t share data. This stops you from getting real business intelligence out of your reporting because there’s no blended view of all the factors that impact your bottom line. Your best report is in Excel, making your data out-of-date and error-prone When your most important business report is stuck in Excel, every manual action you take to import data is an opportunity for errors to creep in and links to break. And after you sink all that time into it, your report is already out-of-date the minute it's done. Turning data into intelligence doesn’t have to be this hard!

The software is packed with features such as GPS tracking, real-time video (others claim they have LIVE video but usually there is a delay), and maintenance logs and alerts… but it doesn’t stop there. If there is a feature that you need the software to do, the FleetChaser team can make it for us. Customer Service is truly top-notch. Mark Value Waste Since I’ve changed over to FleetChaser system, there have been three if not four accidents that I’ve been able to claim that my truck wasn’t there based on GPS coordinates, I was able to use footage from the camera to show that it wasn’t my vehicle involved in the accident and several fender benders where other drivers blamed my garbage truck drivers where I was able to show that it wasn’t the case. Right there the three accidents saved me tons of money by having FleetChaser. Tom B&N Grading, Inc. We began using FleetChaser to track equipment and gather statistics on over 70 pieces of equipment... It didn't take long for FleetChaser to become a vital and irreplaceable resource for our company... We find FleetChaser to be a functional, cost-effective, and easy-to-use tool that pays for itself. It is a tool that earned my full and highest endorsement. David David Rogers Grading For reference, I’ve used a competitive product before and can confidently say that you get a better level of service compared to other offerings and it can be built purpose to meet your business needs. I like the way it's set up month to month instead of a contract. In terms of the actual use cases, I’ve found employees where they weren’t supposed to be which led me to make corrective actions. From a billing perspective, it has let me catch and bill things we wouldn’t have been able to if we couldn’t go back and verify using FleetChaser’s reporting functions. Its load tracking and route reports have been absolutely crucial for our business. Billy Lake Norman Turf, Inc. All lawn mowing companies should use FleetChaser. The “real-time” features are amazing!! We had employees driving 30-40 minutes one way for lunch and taking 45 minutes to eat lunch, then only reporting a 30-minute lunch break. When you add these to your equipment you can see if your employees are making money off of your equipment by mowing non-client yards!! We had it happen to us. We also found the email alerts for maintenance to be so helpful! The trackers paid for themselves in the first month from our savings!

Fleet Chaser allows us to make sure our dump trucks are getting to the sites on time. We can check in on the drivers and notify our clients regarding arrival times.

Learn how easy it is to build with Adalo Scale & Grow your Business with an Adalo App📈 Adalo provides all you need to make money from your app, increase your users, and supercharge your business growth and profits. Choose a plan to get started The world of no code has taken the software and technology industries by storm. What used to take the skill of software engineers has been replaced by tools that make it easy to create your own applications without the knowledge of coding. But no code doesn’t mean you’re compromising power, instead, it means that you’re building your app with visual blocks that are powered by code. The intuitive visual editor takes a complex subject, like coding, and creates a building environment in a common interface for today’s software tools. If you’ve used tools like Powerpoint or Canva , you’ll be able to navigate Adalo. One last thing: no-code tools have dramatically improved the time to launch for an app. What used to take months (sometimes years), now takes weeks, sometimes days. No code has simplified the building process dramatically and lowered the barrier for anyone looking to create their own app. No code tools are for everyone — even folks who know how to code. Begin Building with No Code Screens & Components Feature Templates Database Actions Design Publish Preview & Share Screens & Components Every Adalo app is made up of screens & components. Screens are the individual pages that a user might see as they interact with your app. Components are the elements on each screen that display information such as text, images, lists, buttons, and more. Screens and components are how you will visually build your mobile or web app. See All Adalo’s Components Hire an Adalo Expert Have someone build your app while you focus on the larger picture.

Book a demo today or learn more Learn More Book a Demo Ziplyne makes all your software easier to use & upgrade Your #1 customer is your end user. The #1 complaint they have is how difficult your enterprise software is to use. Deliver a seamless and simplified user experience on top of all your mission-critical software with Ziplyne, the DAP built from the ground up for user adoption: Coupa Workday SuccessFactors Coupa Ziplyne's digital adoption platform (DAP) empowers Coupa users with an intuitive product tour and walkthroughs, designed to streamline the onboarding process and bolster user adoption. This sophisticated adoption strategy reduces support tickets by offering real-time, interactive guidance, allowing users to master Coupa's enterprise software swiftly. With a focus on enhancing user adoption, Ziplyne's DAP is pivotal in optimizing spend management, procurement, and financial workflows, ensuring customers fully leverage their investment in Coupa's robust functionalities. Learn More Ziplyne is 40% less expensive and 90% faster than existing DAPs Ziplyne vs WalkMe Ziplyne vs Typical DAPs Learn More What Our Customers Say Chief Information Officer ""A Winning Combination of Interactive Training and Ongoing Support"" Before Ziplyne we were doing too many things manually in order to achieve results. Our training team, content leaders, subject matter experts, etc. were all disjointed. By having a solution like Ziplyne we have been able to standardize the way we onboard, train and support our end users across all of our enterprise softwares. Director - HR ""Scalable onboarding and training for Workday effortlessly"" Our Workday implementation partner failed to provide us with an effective training plan or strategy for our end users. As a result, we were faced with the challenge of delivering training on a global scale. However, with the help of Ziplyne, we were able to automate our end user training and gain valuable insights and feedback on how our users engage with both Workday and Ziplyne. Chief Procurement Officer ""A must have for your Procurement Transformation"" The company was facing issues with repetitive mistakes and data errors in procurement processes, causing delays in the supply chain. The use of Coupa as the source of truth was not sufficient without proper data governance and guidance. By implementing Ziplyne as a real-time error recognition and business process guidance solution, the company was able to reduce support tickets and improve user understanding. Ziplyne is now referred to as the company's ""guide on the side"" and is being implemented on other applications. Director - IT ""Agile Software Development Meets Automated User Experience"" Ziplyne has helped large enterprise improve user adoption of new software and bridge the gap between legacy systems by providing real-time digital user help guides. It has been integrated in software rollout plans as a benchmark to determine the need of a Digital Adoption Platform to increase the success and adoption of current and future projects. Current Ziplyne Partner Previously with WalkMe “It’s just faster "" I’ve been through WalkMe’s training and Ziplyne’s. Theirs took 3 months; yours took 1 week. And your training was better. Director - IT “Reviewed other DAP software and I found a winner” What’s best about Ziplyne? Hands down… the usability and non-existent learning curve…. The software is super-easy to learn and I obtained results literally in minutes. Within a week of use, you can be an expert. VP of Product “Product manager/UI designer's dream solution “ Provides integrations with zendesk/jira and AI capabilities to reduce repetitive support tasks as well as automation Director of Delivery Ziplyne focuses on the right things that lead to productivity and ROI Ziplyne approaches app guidance differently than other solutions.. The workflow contributes directly to sales and client onboarding so salespeople become productive in less time and customer success is able to focus on the most strategic activities to support customer adoption and growth. Enterprise Platform Creator Ziplyne's Creator module is a versatile solution for product teams, L&D, Training, HR, and IT departments, enabling the seamless creation and management of in-app guides and training.

Learn More The Ziplyne Difference 28 % Decrease in support tickets $ 500 k Reduction in Eng/IT spend 35 % Reduction in training costs Your Enterprise Challenges People are taking notice... Johns Hopkins Enterprise has made multiple investments over multiple years – Partners as well (Veritas Prime) The business cycle is accelerating: there’s not time to wait 16 weeks for an implementation to start, or 18 months for a feature request to go through. Ziplyne is attracting partners like Johns Hopkins University and Veritas Prime because of our unprecedented speed and ease of implementation. Learn More Will you implement a DAP too late…? People have told us that they implemented a DAP…. too late. Habits form quick. If your implementation isn’t guided by relevant training and empowered support agents, your people will learn the wrong habits – wasting your software investment dollars. At Ziplyne, we ensure your support model is in place at time of implementation, and drive internal alignment with your support functions – so the entire implementation can succeed and maximize your dollars, driving the desired business outcomes. Learn More Hours, not months Other DAPs promise the world and deliver much less than that. Our solution can be deployed in hours – not the months it takes legacy solutions. A client of Ziplyne recently said: “I’ve been through WalkMe’s training and Ziplyne’s. Theirs took 3 months; yours took 1 week. And your training was better.” We hear things like this all the time. Click below to see why Learn More Your software is a jailbroken iPhone.. …Customize it, and the vendor no longer supports you.

We met our delivery date with a quality API but even more impressive was the handoff at the end of the process.

På det sättet bygger vi ett system som gör vardagen mer effektiv för våra kunder. Några av de viktigaste punkterna som våra användare efterfrågar är: Tidseffektivt Hög tillgänglighet, snabba svarstider och effektiva sökmöjligheter. Det ska gå snabbt, vara intuitivt och enkelt att hitta det man söker efter. Översikt Bra överblick över samtliga uppdrag och veta i vilken process varje kandidat befinner sig. Snabba svar på det som är viktigast för dig. Kandidatrelation Hjälp att skapa goda kandidatrelationer och stöd för att förbättra kandidatupplevelsen. Bäst kandidatrelation vinner. Kontroll Kontroll över vad som sagts, till vem, när och vem som sa det. Det är också viktigt att veta vad som skall göras och få underlag för att prioritera. Mobilt Ett system som är tillgängligt även när du är på språng. Det skall också vara enkelt för kandidaten att söka jobb med sin mobil. Sökbarhet Omfattande sökfunktionalitet så att du kan hitta rätt kandidater vid rätt tidpunkt. Det måste också finnas enkla sätt att förädla data för att ytterligare öka sökbarheten. Det ultimata rekryteringsverktyget Rekrytering är en värdeskapande process och ett hantverk som kräver rätt verktyg. Det här vet du som professionell rekryterare. Ponty är verktyget som omfattar både kandidathantering och ett anpassat CRM- och säljstöd. Läs mer om systemet Varför vi finns Vi har valt att bygga ett systemstöd för professionella rekryterare och idag samarbetar vi med några av Sveriges bästa.

Having a technology that I can get duplicating through an organization is not just nice to have, it’s now mandatory. It’s necessary. And I believe as we expand our company all over the world, this platform is going to be the main reason."" John Malott CEO, O’Snap Active Lifestyle "" I recently worked with the RapidFunnel team to launch my App. I’m a high-maintenance person who is very particular and likes to be in control.

Melissa Dawson Impact CEO, Solar Business Development at Powur "" If you’re building a large organization of independent agents there is no simpler route. RapidFunnel gives people an easy way to authentically share our company story, while also helping them lock-in to my exact training methods. And it gives me real-time analytics and back-end data I need to build smarter."" Jefferson Santos Top Leader and Entrepreneur "" They’re head and shoulders above any other vendor we’ve worked with in terms of experience. So many vendors provide a vehicle, but they don’t teach you how to drive it or explain the strategy behind it. We appreciate the service that RapidFunnel brings to the table."" Mitch Hancock CEO, Zallevo "" The ability for us to be able to look at lead indicators versus lag indicators - being able to look inside at the activities going on in the organization that actually lead to the conversions - is a key differentiator as to why RapidFunnel is a better tool than we’ve been able to create ourselves.

Every day. Data System Deephaven is an open-core * framework and query engine for working with streaming tables. Use dynamic data in tables with the same ease as static dataframes. Data Sources Access and ingest data directly from popular, standard formats. For example, use a Kafka event stream alongside historical Parquet data. Data Processing Stream updating and real-time derived data to consumers. Connect JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++ clients and receive live updates or snapshots. Write to persistent stores. Build and share real-time visualizations and monitors. Explore massive and ticking datasets with built-in tools. Connect enterprise apps. Data Consumers Exhaust new streams or write to persistent stores, build and share real-time visualizations and monitors. Explore massive and ticking datasets with built in tools. Build enterprise apps. Why Deephaven? Streaming data done right Serious performance Engineered to track table additions, removals, modifications, and shifts, users benefit from Deephaven’s highly-optimized, incremental-update model. A chunk-oriented architecture delivers best-of-class table methods and amortizes the cost of moving between languages. Client-server interfaces are designed with large-scale, dense data in mind -- moving compute to the server and providing lazy updates.
